1
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,698
So you were raised
in a zoo?

2
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,074
Born and raised.

3
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,703
In Pondicherry, in what was
the French part of lndia.

4
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,747
My father owned the zoo...

5
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:11,208
and I was
delivered on short notice
by a herpetologist...

6
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,879
who was there to check
on the Bengal monitor lizard.

7
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,423
Mother and I
were both healthy...

8
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,216
but the poor lizard escaped...

9
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,428
and was trampled
by a frightened cassowary.

10
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,891
The way of karma, huh?

11
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,435
The way of God.

12
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,146
That's quite a story.

13
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,023
I had assumed
your father was a

14
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,524
mathematician
because of your name.

15
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,778
Far from it,
I was named after
a swimming pool.

16
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,781
There is
a swimming pool named "Pi"?

17
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,201
You see,
my uncle Francis was born

18
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,453
with too much
water in his lungs.

19
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,872
They say the doctors
swung Francis around

20
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,083
by the ankles to
clear the water out...

21
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,919
and that's what gave him
the huge chest
and skinny legs...

22
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,380
that made him
such a great swimmer.

23
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,007
Is Francis
actually your uncle?

24
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,884
He said he was
friends with your father.

25
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,054
He's my honorary uncle,
I call him Mamaji.

26
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,974
My father's best friend,
my swimming guru.

27
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,727
I trained with him
three times a week
at the ashram.

28
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,939
His lessons would
save my life in the end.

29
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:20,111
A mouthful of water
will not harm you,
but panic will.

30
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,615
Remember to breathe now,
don't hold your breath.

31
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,450
Good boy.

32
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,622
I hope you don't
mind vegetarian.

33
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,125
No, no. Not at all.

34
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,252
And your name?
Huh?

35
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,422
You were going to tell me
how you got
your name, I think.

36
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,592
Oh, yes.
I got it from something
Mamaji once told my father.

37
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,469
You see,
most travelers collect

38
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,234
postcards or teacups
on their journeys...

39
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,347
but not Mamaji.

40
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,599
Mamaji collects
swimming pools.

41
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,477
He swims in every
pool he comes upon.

42
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,487
One day, Mamaji
said to my father that,

43
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,448
of all the pools
in the world...

44
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,951
the most beautiful was
a public pool in Paris.

45
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,703
That the water
there was so clear,

46
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,997
you could make
your morning coffee
with it.

47
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,500
That a single swim
there changed his life.

48
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,141
Before I was born, he said...

49
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,894
"If you want your son
to have a clean soul..."

50
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:39,482
"you must take him one day
to swim
in the Piscine Molitor."

51
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,486
I never
understood why my father
took this so much to heart.

52
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:49,158
But he did, and I was named
"Piscine Molitor Patel."

53
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,369
Imagine me trying
to explain that name.

54
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,206
I barely made it to
the age of 11 before...

55
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,416
Hey, Piscine!

56
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,212
Are you pissing right now?

57
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,380
Look at him,
he's pissing!

58
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,718
With one word,
my name went from an elegant
French swimming pool...

59
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,678
to a stinking
Indian latrine.

60
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,680
I was "Pissing" everywhere.

61
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,517
No Pissing
in the schoolyard!

62
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,686
Even the teachers
started doing it.

63
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,188
Not deliberately, of course.

64
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,234
So, then, what might occur
if we release gas too quickly?

65
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,527
Pissing?

66
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,238
He said "Pissing."

67
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,538
That's enough!
Order! Order!

68
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,791
When we returned
the next year for
our first day of school,

69
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,084
I was prepared.

70
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,544
Present, sir.

71
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,130
Piscine Patel.

72
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:53,055
Good morning.
I am Piscine Molitor Patel.

73
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,224
Known to all as...

74
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,728
Pi, the sixteenth letter
of the Greek alphabet...

75
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,566
which is also
used in mathematics
to represent the ratio...

76
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,236
of any circle's circumference
to its diameter.

77
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,446
An irrational number
of infinite length,

78
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,657
usually rounded
to three digits...

79
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:16,453
as 3. 14.

80
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,081
Pi.

81
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:24,587
Very impressive, Pi.
Now, sit down.

82
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,758
And from then on,
you were "Pi"?

83
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,469
Well, no, not quite.

84
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,680
Nice try, Pissing.

85
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,684
But I still had the whole
day ahead of me.

86
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,436
French class was next.

87
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,771
Je m'appelle
Piscine Molitor Patel.

88
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,607
Dit Pi.

89
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,319
Then, geography.

90
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:52,114
These are the first
20 decimal places of pi.

91
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,284
My last class
of the day
was mathematics.

92
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,872
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

93
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:11,300
Three.
Seven. Five. Eight. Nine.

94
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:16,138
Eight. Five. Eight. Nine.

95
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,141
It's right.
He's really doing this.

96
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,728
Pi! Pi! Pi!

97
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:27,816
By the end of that day,
I was Pi Patel, school legend.

98
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,571
Um, Mamaji tells me
you're a legend
among sailors, too.

99
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,864
Out there, all alone.

100
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,200
Oh, I don't even know
how to sail.

101
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,495
And I wasn't alone out there.
Richard Parker was with me.

102
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,373
Richard Parker?

103
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,041
Mamaji didn't tell me
everything.

104
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,044
He just said
I should look you up
when I got back to Montreal.

105
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,046
So, what were you
doing in Pondicherry?

106
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,341
Writing a novel.

107
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,343
By the way,
I enjoyed your first book.

108
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,012
So, this new one,
is it set in India?

109
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,683
No, Portugal, actually.
But it's cheaper
living in India.

110
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,437
Ah, well,
I look forward
to reading it.

111
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,563
You can't.

112
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,941
I threw it out.

113
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,989
Two years
trying to bring
this thing to life...

114
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,947
and then one day,
it sputtered,
coughed and died.

115
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,616
Oh, I'm sorry.

116
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,955
Uh, I was sitting in
this coffee house in
Pondicherry one afternoon,

117
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,164
mourning my loss...

118
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:28,085
when this old man
at the table next to me
struck up a conversation.

119
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,920
Yeah, Mamaji,
he does that.

120
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,066
When I told him
about my abandoned book,
he said...

121
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,360
"So, a Canadian
who's come to French India

122
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,051
"in search of a story."

123
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,263
"Well, my friend,
I know an Indian
in French Canada..."

124
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,224
"with the most
incredible story to tell."

125
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:46,562
"It must be fate
that the two of you
should meet."

126
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,110
Well, I haven't spoken
about Richard Parker
in so many years.

127
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,904
So, what has
Mamaji already told you?

128
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,658
He said you had a story
that would make me
believe in God.

129
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:03,245
He would
say that about a nice meal.

130
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,249
As for God,
I can only tell you
my story.

131
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,086
You will decide for yourself
what you believe.

132
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,921
Fair enough.

133
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,008
Let's see, then.
Where to begin?

134
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,305
Pondicherry
is the French Riviera
of India.

135
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,394
In the streets
closest to the ocean,

136
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,189
you might think
you were in
the south of France.

137
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,778
A few blocks inland,
there's a canal.

138
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,280
Just beyond that
is Indian Pondicherry.

139
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,826
And the Muslim quarter
is just to the west.

140
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:46,455
When the French
handed Pondicherry
back to us in 1954...

141
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:50,125
the town decided that
some sort of
commemoration was in order.

142
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:54,129
My father,
who was a clever businessman,
came up with one.

143
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,716
He ran a hotel,
and he got
the idea to open a zoo...

144
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,677
in the local
botanical gardens instead.

145
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:07,017
As it also happened,
my mother was
a botanist in the gardens.

146
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:11,897
They met,
married, and a year later
my brother Ravi was born.

147
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,233
I came two years
after that.

148
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,404
It sounds magical,
growing up in...

149
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,536
Amen.

150
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,163
Yeah, let's eat.

151
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,165
I didn't know
Hindus said "amen."

152
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,667
Catholic Hindus do.

153
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:32,918
Catholic Hindus?

154
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,005
We get to feel guilty
before hundreds of gods,
instead of just one.

155
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,426
But you're a Hindu first?

156
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,554
None of us knows God
until someone introduces us.

157
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,515
I was first
introduced to God
as a Hindu.

158
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,268
There are 33 million gods
in the Hindu religion.

159
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,520
How can I not
come to know
a few of them?

160
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,275
I met Krishna first.

161
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,237
Yashoda once accused
baby Krishna of eating dirt.

162
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,075
"Tut, tut you naughty boy -
you shouldn't do that."

163
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,287
But he didn't!

164
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,831
That's what he told her.

165
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,916
"I didn't eat dirt."

166
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,712
Yashoda said,
"No? Well then..."

167
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,047
"Open your mouth."

168
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,967
So Krishna opened his mouth.

169
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,136
And what do you think
Yashoda saw?

170
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,429
What?

171
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:33,812
She saw in Krishna's mouth
the whole entire universe.

172
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,134
The gods were my
superheroes growing up.

173
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,595
Hanuman, the monkey god...

174
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:10,599
Lifting an entire mountain
to save his friend Lakshman.

175
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,101
Ganesh, the elephant-headed...

176
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,523
risking his life
to defend the honor
of his mother, Parvati.

177
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:22,778
Vishnu, the supreme soul,
the source of all things.

178
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,865
Vishnu sleeps, floating
on the shoreless
cosmic ocean...

179
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,952
and we are
the stuff of his dreaming.

180
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,330
Spectacle.

181
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,793
Don't let these stories
and pretty lights
fool you, boys.

182
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:42,047
Religion is darkness.

183
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,844
My dear appa believed
himself part of the new India.

184
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,973
As a child,
he had had polio.

185
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,352
He used to lie in bed
racked with pain,
wondering where God was.

186
00:14:56,187 --> 00:15:00,357
In the end,
God didn't save him,
Western medicine did.

187
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,153
My Amma went to college...

188
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,156
and thought her family
was part of
the new India as well...

189
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,992
until her parents
cut her off...

190
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,536
because they thought
she was marrying beneath her.

191
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,416
Her religion was
the only link
she had to her past.

192
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,721
I met Christ
in the mountains
when I was 12.

193
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,600
We were visiting relatives,
tea growers in Munnar.

194
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:39,021
It was our third day there.
Ravi and I were
terribly bored.

195
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,107
Challenge.
I'll give you two rupees.

196
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,444
Run in to that church
and drink the holy water.

197
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,193
You must be thirsty.

198
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,448
Here.

199
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,408
I brought you this.

200
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,468
Why would a god do that?

201
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,762
Why would
He send his own son...

202
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,307
to suffer for the sins
of ordinary people?

203
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,434
Because He loves us.

204
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,813
God made Himself
approachable to us,

205
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,607
human,
so we could understand Him.

206
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,360
We can't understand God
in all His perfection.

207
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,113
But we can
understand God's son

208
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,865
and His suffering
as we would a brother's.

209
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,326
That made no sense.

210
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:20,956
Sacrificing the innocent
to atone for the sins
of the guilty...

211
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,125
What kind of love
is that?

212
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,629
But this son...

213
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,297
I couldn't get
him out of my head.

214
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,470
If God is so
perfect and we are not...

215
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,682
why would He want
to create all this?

216
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,226
Why does He
need us at all?

217
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,521
All you have to know
is that He loves us.

218
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,899
God so loved this world
that He gave His only son.

219
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,026
The longer
I listened to the priest...

220
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,196
the more I came to like
this son of God.

221
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:57,325
Thank you, Vishnu,
for introducing me to Christ.

222
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,127
I came to faith
through Hinduism

223
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,504
and I found God's
love through Christ.

224
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,174
But God wasn't
finished with me yet.

225
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,853
God works
in mysterious ways.

226
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,522
And so it was,
He introduced Himself again.

227
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,400
This time
by the name of Allah.

228
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,709
Allahu Akbar.

229
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,547
My Arabic
was never very good...

230
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,384
but the sound
and feel of the words
brought me closer to God.

231
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,761
In performing Salah...

232
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,096
the ground I touched
became holy ground...

233
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,725
and I found a feeling
of serenity and brotherhood.

234
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,071
This lamb is exquisite.

235
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,782
It's the best
dish on the table.

236
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,951
You're all missing out.

237
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,580
You only need to convert
to three more religions,
Piscine...

238
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,917
and you will spend
your life on holiday.

239
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,420
Are you going to
Mecca this year,
Swami Jesus?

240
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,841
Or to Rome
for your coronation
as Pope Pi-us?

241
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,759
You stay
out of this, Ravi.

242
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,011
Just as you like cricket,
Pi has his own interests.

243
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,430
No, GITA,
Ravi has a point.

244
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:47,143
You cannot follow
three different religions
at the same time, Piscine.

245
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,603
Why not?

246
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,357
Because believing
in everything
at the same time...

247
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,777
is the same as not believing
in anything at all.

248
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,114
He's young, SANTOSH.
He's still finding his way.

249
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:02,701
And how can he find his way
if he does not choose a path?

250
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,831
Listen, instead of leaping
from one religion
to the next...

251
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,000
why not start with reason?

252
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,002
In a few hundred years...

253
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,880
science has taken us
farther in understanding
the universe...

254
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,799
than religion has
in 10, 000.

255
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,344
That is true.

256
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,804
Your father is right.

257
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,516
Science can teach us
more about what
is out there...

258
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,476
but not what is in here.

259
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,188
Some eat meat,
some eat vegetable.

260
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,691
I do not expect us all
to agree about everything...

261
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,693
but I would much
rather have you

262
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,537
believe in something
I don't agree with...

263
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,489
than to accept
everything blindly.

264
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,493
And that begins
with thinking rationally.

265
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,663
Do you understand?

266
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,542
Good.

267
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,425
I would like
to be baptized.

268
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,434
So, you're
a Christian
and a Muslim?

269
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,019
And a Hindu,
of course.

270
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,354
And a Jew, I suppose.

271
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,523
Well, I do teach a course
on the Kabbalah
at the university.

272
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,360
And why not?
Faith is a house
with many rooms.

273
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,111
But no room
for doubt?

274
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,947
Oh, plenty.
On every floor.

275
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,531
Doubt is useful.

276
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,742
It keeps faith
a living thing.

277
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,078
After all,
you cannot know
the strength of your faith

278
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,371
until it's been tested.

279
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,211
Where's Selvam?
We shouldn't be in
here without him.

280
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,879
Stop worrying.

281
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,384
I have seen him
do this a thousand times.

282
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,764
I want to meet
our new tiger.

283
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:49,808
Pi!

284
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,560
Hello? Richard Parker?

285
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,939
A tiger?
Richard Parker
was a tiger?

286
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,942
Yeah, he got his name
through a clerical error.

287
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,112
A hunter caught him
drinking from a stream
when he was a cub...

288
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,072
and named him Thirsty.

289
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,242
When Thirsty got too big,
the hunter sold him
to our zoo...

290
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,245
but the names got switched
on the paperwork.

291
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,872
The hunter was listed
as Thirsty,

292
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,833
and the tiger
was called Richard Parker.

293
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,628
We laughed about it,
and the name stuck.

294
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,505
Let's go...

295
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,466
before we
get into trouble.

296
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,468
I want to see him
close up.

297
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,095
You're not
a zookeeper.

298
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,097
Come on!

299
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,617
That's it,
Richard Parker.

300
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,494
It's for you.

301
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:21,983
No!

302
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,320
What are you thinking?

303
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,155
Are you
out of your mind?

304
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,365
Who gave you permission
to come back here?

305
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,911
You have
just ignored everything
I've ever taught you.

306
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,247
I just wanted to
say hello to him.

307
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,500
You think that tiger
is your friend?

308
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,002
He's an animal,
not a playmate.

309
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,339
Animals have souls.

310
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,841
I have seen it
in their eyes.

311
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,096
Find Selvam.

312
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,776
You're sure, Sir?
Pi's just a boy.

313
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,861
Do it. Go ahead!

314
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,532
Animals do not think
like we do.

315
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,535
People who forget that
get themselves killed.

316
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,872
That tiger
is not your friend.

317
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,541
When you look into
his eyes...

318
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,046
Nothing else.

319
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,221
Don't be stupid.
Say you're sorry.

320
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,760
What have you done,
Piscine?

321
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,221
You know what
your father said about
coming back here.

322
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,225
I am sorry. I was...

323
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,144
What are you thinking?

324
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,062
This is between
a father and his sons.

325
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,315
He said he's sorry.

326
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,942
You want to
scar them for life?

327
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,070
Scar them?
That boy almost lost his arm.

328
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,572
But he's still a boy.

329
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,448
He will be a man
sooner than you think.

330
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,577
And this is a lesson
I do not want them
ever to forget.

331
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,745
Selvam!

332
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,815
... and so
has placed the country
in a state of emergency.

333
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,133
Under the directive,
the states of
Gujarat and Tamil Nadu...

334
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,345
will be placed under
the direct authority
of the central government.

335
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,365
Police will be
granted powers...

336
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,724
to arrest and indefinitely
detain citizens

337
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,517
responsible for the uprising.

338
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,817
Things changed
after the day
of Appa's lesson.

339
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,654
The world had lost
some of its enchantment.

340
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:16,824
School was a bore.
Nothing but facts,
fractions and French.

341
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:21,412
Words and patterns
that went on and on,
without end.

342
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,082
Just like
my irrational nickname.

343
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,547
I grew restless
searching for something

344
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:34,259
that might bring meaning
back into my life.

345
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,096
And then, I met Anandi.

346
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,856
Mother made me study music.

347
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,442
And one day,
my teacher
came down with the flu.

348
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,736
He asked if
I could take his place,

349
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,613
playing rhythms
for a dance class.

350
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,089
No.

351
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,216
If you
do not concentrate...

352
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,761
you cannot express
your love of God
through dance.

353
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,055
Feel the ground
beneath your feet.

354
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,725
Open your gaze out
onto the horizon.

355
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:28,438
Let that spiritual energy
pulse through you
and out into the world.

356
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,565
Through abhinaya.

357
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,818
Anandi, come to the front.
Lead them.

358
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,615
Why are you following me?

359
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:21,866
What?

360
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,660
You were following me.

361
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,123
What does this mean?

362
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,211
In the dance,
you went from pataka...

363
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,838
which means the forest.

364
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,800
And then you did...

365
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,344
samputa...

366
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:44,180
which means
something that is hidden.

367
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,973
And after that,
you did this.

368
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,186
And then you did chatura.

369
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,898
But at the very end,
you did this.

370
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,318
None of the other
dancers did that.

371
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,655
What did you mean?
The god of love
is hiding in the forest?

372
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:03,658
No, that also means
the lotus flower.

373
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,494
Lotus flower
is hiding in the forest?

374
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,415
Why would a lotus flower
hide in the forest?

375
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,425
And this
is Richard Parker.

376
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,802
He is the most
magnificent creature

377
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,512
we've ever had here.

378
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,682
Look at the way
he's turning his head.

379
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,895
Showing off. Like a dancer.

380
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,356
No, he heard something.

381
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,319
He's listening, you see?

382
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,873
We have talked
about it for some time.

383
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,208
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

384
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:55,710
Pi?

385
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,713
Sorry, you've been...

386
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,423
Worried.

387
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,383
For my family.

388
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,553
Our animals are worth
far more abroad
than here in India.

389
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,722
And if the town council
stops supporting us...

390
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,724
I don't know
where we will be.

391
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,268
So, it is what
we have to do.

392
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,146
Do you understand?

393
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,233
I'm sorry,
what are we talking about?

394
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,819
We are leaving India.

395
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,655
What?

396
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,242
We are selling the zoo.

397
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,121
The zoo
was never ours to sell.
The land belongs to the town.

398
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,415
But the animals
are ours
and if we sell them...

399
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,667
we will have enough
to start a new life.

400
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,087
But where would we go?
Our life is here, Appa.

401
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,255
Canada.

402
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,091
I have some opportunities
for work in Winnipeg.

403
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,261
I'll be shipping
most of the animals
for sale in North America.

404
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,972
We can get freighter passage
for the whole family.

405
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,599
So...

406
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,351
It is settled.

407
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,270
We will sail like Columbus.

408
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,524
But Columbus
was looking for India.

409
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,868
Lt takes
a lot of work to sell a zoo.

410
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,703
Before we left...

411
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:16,499
Anandi and I had time enough
to break each other's hearts.

412
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:20,336
Of course, I promised
I would come back one day.

413
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:22,672
It's funny.

414
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,967
I remember everything else
about our last day.

415
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,220
But I don't remember
saying goodbye.

416
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:41,190
Pi?
They're serving
dinner below.

417
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,997
Piscine...

418
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,666
you have a whole life
ahead of you.

419
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,003
We are doing this
for you and Ravi.

420
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,382
Come inside
and have some dinner.

421
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,685
Vegetarian, please.

422
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,897
Oh, my sons
and I are vegetarians.
Do you have anything...

423
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,192
No, no, no.
Not more gravy.

424
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,111
You don't want gravy?
No.

425
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,239
No, I want something
vegetarian.

426
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,575
Oh.

427
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,703
Pas de problème.

428
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,250
She asked if you have
something vegetarian.

429
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,047
The cow that produced
this liver was vegetarian,

430
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,133
the pigs that went into
these sausages were vegetarian.

431
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,593
Very funny.

432
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,055
But my wife doesn't eat liver.

433
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,517
Pas de problème.

434
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:02,480
Then she can eat the sausage,
the rice, and the gravy.

435
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,982
Or you can cook your own food.

436
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,818
How dare you talk
to my wife like that?

437
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,279
Here's your rice.

438
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,075
I cook for sailors...

439
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,743
not curry-eaters.

440
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:17,411
What did you say?

441
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:18,454
Let go of me!

442
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:22,124
Who do you think you are?
You're nothing but a servant!

443
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,752
I feed people!
You feed monkeys!

444
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,929
Hello.

445
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,639
I am happy Buddhist.

446
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,599
So, I eat rice

447
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,601
next to gravy.

448
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:44,313
On ship,
gravy is not meat.

449
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,648
Is taste.

450
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,692
You try?

451
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,383
Don't worry.

452
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:17,680
We will have
plenty of fresh supplies
after we stop in Manila.

453
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:23,144
Why give Orange Juice
tranquilizers?

454
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,230
She's not going to
cause any trouble.

455
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,358
The stress of traveling
is not good for the animals...

456
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,319
and it helps
with the seasickness.

457
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:39,660
We don't want
to be cleaning up
after a seasick orangutan...

458
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,495
do we?

459
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,045
My father
was a businessman.

460
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,548
He had never tended
the animals himself.

461
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:55,426
I realized...

462
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,555
leaving India must
have been harder for him
than it was for me.

463
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,771
So...

464
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,398
Have I forgotten
anything?

465
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,691
I think you've set
the stage.

466
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,236
So far, we have an Indian boy
named after
a French swimming pool...

467
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,698
on a Japanese
ship full of animals,
heading to Canada.

468
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,116
Yes.

469
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:23,037
Now, we have to send our boy
into the middle of
the Pacific and...

470
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:26,207
And make me
believe in God.

471
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,084
Yeah.

472
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,128
We'll get there.

473
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,761
It was four days
out of Manila...

474
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:42,056
above the Mariana Trench,
the deepest spot on Earth.

475
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,687
Our ship,
The Tsimtsum, pushed on,

476
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,815
bullishly indifferent
to its surroundings.

477
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:57,154
It moved with the slow,
massive confidence
of a continent.

478
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,817
Ravi?

479
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,944
Did you hear that, Ravi?

480
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,320
I'm sleeping.

481
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,489
It's a thunderstorm.
Let's go watch.

482
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:41,949
Are you crazy?

483
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,201
We will get hit
by lightning.

484
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,288
No, we won't.
It will hit
the bridge first.

485
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,166
Don't tempt a storm, Pi.

486
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,931
Whoa.

487
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,654
Oh!

488
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,942
More rain! More rain!

489
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,947
Lord of Storms!

490
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,574
Whoa!

491
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,993
Lightning!

492
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,054
Ah!

493
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,076
Amma!

494
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:51,495
Appa!

495
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,792
Ravi! Get out! Get out!

496
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,415
Help me!

497
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,963
Help!

498
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,467
Get in the boat!

499
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,635
Please! Save my family!

500
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,596
Don't scare, okay?
Wait, stay here!

501
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,347
You have to help them!
Please!

502
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,807
Put this on.

503
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,393
No, no, my family!
Please!

504
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,147
We have to help them!

505
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:02,608
We don't have time.
My family's back there!

506
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:05,027
We help!
You must go!

507
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,361
Who let
all the animals out?

508
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,780
You have to go now!

509
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,240
No, wait, my father!
He can't swim!

510
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,366
Go!

511
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,247
Hang on to the boat!
Hold, hold!

512
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,083
Bring it down!

513
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:31,011
Hey! You!
What are you doing?

514
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,680
Jump!

515
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,058
Hey, hey!

516
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:43,458
Hey! Over here!
Over here!

517
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,828
Richard Parker?

518
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,663
No! No!

519
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:25,751
No! Go away! Go away!

520
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,236
Agh!

521
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,716
Amma!

522
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:41,845
Appa! Ravi.

523
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,224
I'm sorry.

524
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:51,855
I'm sorry!

525
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,293
Hari?

526
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,831
Looks as though
your drugs
haven't worn off yet.

527
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:33,850
Orange Juice!
Orange Juice!

528
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,366
Welcome to Pi's Ark.

529
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:16,476
Where is your boy,
Orange Juice?

530
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:30,907
Don't worry,
I bet mother and father
found him.

531
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,871
They'll all be here soon.

532
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:52,755
Hello!

533
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,101
Anybody!

534
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,582
No!

535
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:07,962
Stop it! No!
Stop it! Stop it!

536
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:15,387
No! No!

537
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,559
I'm sorry, Orange Juice.

538
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,895
I don't have
any seasickness medicine
for you.

539
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,108
Supplies.
Oh, supplies!

540
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,094
Yes! Yes!

541
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:34,567
No! No!

542
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:57,131
Come on! Come on!

543
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,008
Come on!

544
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,450
Mmm.

545
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,210
My name is Pi Patel.

546
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,213
I have been in a shipwreck.

547
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,550
I am on a lifeboat alone...

548
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,053
with a tiger.

549
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:58,057
Please send help.

550
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,877
God, I give myself to you.

551
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,922
I am your vessel.

552
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:58,552
Whatever comes,
I want to know.

553
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,348
Show me.

554
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,735
There are no lines.

555
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:23,035
Set your house
in order and dig in
for the battle to survive.

556
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,830
Establish a strict
schedule for eating,

557
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:28,374
keeping watch
and getting rest.

558
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:32,294
Do not drink
urine or sea water.

559
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:38,384
Keep busy
but avoid
unnecessary exertion.

560
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,723
The mind can be kept occupied
by playing card games...

561
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:47,226
Twenty Questions, or I Spy.

562
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:54,066
Community singing
is another surefire way
to lift the spirits.

563
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,822
Telling stories
is highly recommended.

564
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,954
Above all, don't lose hope.

565
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:19,175
Few things can sap
the spirit
faster than seasickness.

566
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:25,181
Waves are most strongly felt
when a boat turns
sideways to the current.

567
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:29,977
A sea anchor is used
as a drag to keep the boat's
head to the wind.

568
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,813
Proper use of them
can increase control

569
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,608
and reduce seasickness
during rough seas.

570
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,737
For castaways
who must share
their lifeboats with large,

571
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,197
dangerous carnivores...

572
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:44,658
it's advisable to establish
a territory as your own.

573
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,327
Try this method.

574
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:47,578
Step one.

575
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,790
Choose a day
when waves are moderate,
but regular.

576
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:54,168
Step two.
With the lifeboat
facing into the waves...

577
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:58,798
making the ride
as comfortable as possible,
blow your whistle soothingly.

578
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,510
Step three.
Turn the lifeboat
sideways to the waves...

579
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:05,846
accompanied by harsh,
aggressive use
of the whistle.

580
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,640
With sufficient repetition...

581
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:09,968
the animal will associate
the sound of the whistle...

582
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:12,561
with the discomfort
of seasickness.

583
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,398
Similar methods have
long been used by
circus trainers...

584
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,652
though they generally lack
access to rough seas.

585
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:22,822
Let the trumpets blare!

586
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:26,742
Let the drum rolls begin!

587
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,162
Prepare to be amazed!

588
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:34,542
Here it is,
for your enjoyment
and instruction!

589
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:39,505
The show you've
been waiting for
all your life...

590
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,633
will soon begin!

591
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,262
Are you ready for
the miracle of it?

592
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,432
Well, then, I give to you...

593
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,020
the astounding Bengal tiger!

594
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:10,369
Hello, Richard Parker.
Sorry about the choppy ride.

595
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:49,283
Mine!
You understand?
Yours, mine!

596
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,413
You understand?

597
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,422
Ew!

598
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,093
Step four.

599
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,847
Disregard steps
one through three.

600
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:43,963
Here, Richard Parker.
I got some water for you.

601
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:02,314
In the zoo, we fed our tigers
an average of five kilos
of meat a day.

602
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:06,026
Richard Parker
will be getting hungry soon.

603
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,573
Tigers are powerful swimmers,
and if he gets
hungry enough...

604
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,742
I'm afraid
the little bit of water
between us

605
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,869
won't be any protection.

606
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,539
I need to find a way
to feed him.

607
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:22,251
I can eat the biscuits
but God made
tigers carnivores...

608
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,503
so I must learn to
catch fish.

609
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,381
If I don't,
I'm afraid his last meal

610
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,675
will be a skinny,
vegetarian boy.

611
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,562
Patience!

612
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:49,648
What am I doing?

613
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:10,210
Wait! I'm thinking.

614
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,803
Thirty-two cartons
of biscuits.

615
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,599
Ninety-three cans of water.

616
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,340
I'm sorry.

617
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,677
I'm sorry.

618
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:10,599
Thank you, Lord Vishnu.

619
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:14,895
Thank you for coming
in the form of a fish
and saving our lives.

620
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:17,689
Thank you.

621
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:28,403
Of course,
I brought all
the biscuits and water

622
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:31,072
on the raft with me
to keep them safe.

623
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,492
Idiot.

624
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,246
Hunger can
change everything you

625
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,582
ever thought you
knew about yourself.

626
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,759
Here, it's yours!

627
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,316
Oh! Ah!

628
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,163
Mine! Mine!

629
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:50,814
I can't risk my life
every time

630
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:53,692
I have to climb
onto the boat for supplies.

631
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:56,027
It's time to settle this.

632
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,071
If we're going
to live together,

633
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,699
we have to learn
to communicate.

634
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,493
Maybe Richard Parker
can't be tamed,

635
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:06,371
but with God's will,
he can be trained.

636
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:17,358
No!

637
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:27,786
Good.

638
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:49,951
Go, Richard Parker. Go.

639
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:52,912
Go on home,
I'll leave you alone.

640
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,040
I'll respect that,
I promise.

641
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:02,714
Go. Come on.

642
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,390
Yes!

643
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:49,010
I never thought
a small piece of shade

644
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,804
could bring me
so much happiness.

645
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:57,268
That a pile of tools,
a bucket, a knife, a pencil...

646
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,479
might become my
greatest treasures.

647
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:03,775
Or that knowing
Richard Parker was here
might ever bring me peace.

648
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,277
In times like these...

649
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:08,696
I remember that he has
as little experience

650
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:11,324
with the real world as I do.

651
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:14,827
We were both raised in a zoo
by the same master.

652
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:19,958
Now we've been orphaned,
left to face our
ultimate master together.

653
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:23,670
Without Richard Parker,
I would have died by now.

654
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,172
My fear of him keeps me alert.

655
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,634
Tending to his needs
gives my life purpose.

656
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,057
Dolphins.

657
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:38,351
Hey, Richard Parker!

658
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,412
Hey!

659
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:53,718
Above all,
don't lose hope.

660
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:29,629
Eight, five, five,
zero, three, six, six...

661
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:32,298
zero, eight, zero, one...

662
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:37,261
three, six, zero, four,
six, six, eight...

663
01:23:45,104 --> 01:23:47,480
What are you looking at?

664
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:54,028
Talk to me.

665
01:23:57,658 --> 01:23:59,867
Tell me what you see.

666
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:10,081
Words are all I have
left to hang on to.

667
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:14,001
Everything mixed up.
Fragmented.

668
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:19,757
Can't tell daydreams,
night dreams,
from reality anymo......

669
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,944
Storm, Richard Parker.

670
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:08,806
No!

671
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:15,563
No!

672
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:42,381
Praise be to God!

673
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,051
Lord of all worlds!

674
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:48,846
The compassionate,
the merciful!

675
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,222
Ah!

676
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:57,188
Come out.

677
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:02,860
Richard Parker!
Come out,
you have to see this!

678
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:05,863
It's beautiful!

679
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:21,045
Don't hide yourself!
He's come to us!

680
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:22,880
It's a miracle!

681
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:40,064
Come out and see God,
Richard Parker!

682
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:56,080
Why are you scaring him?

683
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:57,248
Oh, God!

684
01:28:57,416 --> 01:29:02,086
I've lost my family!
I've lost everything!

685
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:06,674
I surrender!
What more do you want?

686
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:32,324
I'm sorry, Richard Parker.

687
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:42,932
We're dying,
Richard Parker.

688
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:49,146
I'm sorry.

689
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:25,849
Amma, Appa, Ravi...

690
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:31,188
I'm happy I'm going
to see you soon.

691
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:42,992
Can you feel the rain?

692
01:34:01,511 --> 01:34:06,390
God, thank you for
giving me my life.

693
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,561
I'm ready now.

694
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,761
Richard Parker?

695
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:33,685
Mmm.

696
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,194
Excuse me.

697
01:36:24,946 --> 01:36:26,655
Move.

698
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:29,867
Move. Excuse me.

699
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:44,459
Hey! Hey!

700
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:46,837
Hey, come on!

701
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:50,841
Hey.

702
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:55,262
Hey, get away.
This is my bed.

703
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,892
It was a human tooth?

704
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:09,146
Don't you see?
The island was
carnivorous.

705
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:12,149
Carnivorous?
Like a Venus Flytrap?

706
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:15,152
Yes, the whole island.

707
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:19,781
The plants,
the water in those pools,
the very ground itself.

708
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:23,452
During the day,
those pools held
fresh water.

709
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:25,745
But at night,
some chemical process

710
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:28,832
turned the water
in those pools into acid...

711
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:32,002
acid that dissolved
those fish...

712
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:34,671
that sent the MEERKATS
scurrying into the trees,

713
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:36,965
and Richard Parker
running to the boat.

714
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:39,134
But where did
the tooth come from?

715
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:42,095
Years ago, some poor fellow,
just like me...

716
01:41:42,263 --> 01:41:45,015
must have found himself
stranded on that island...

717
01:41:45,183 --> 01:41:48,518
and, like me,
thought he might
stay there forever.

718
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:53,523
But all that
the island gave him by day,
it took away again by night.

719
01:41:55,026 --> 01:42:00,197
To think, how many hours
spent with only MEERKATS
for company.

720
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:02,782
How much loneliness
taken on.

721
01:42:03,159 --> 01:42:05,368
All I know is that
eventually he died

722
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:07,454
and the island
digested him...

723
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:10,373
leaving behind
only his teeth.

724
01:42:11,709 --> 01:42:15,170
I saw how my life would end
if I stayed on that island.

725
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:17,047
Alone and forgotten.

726
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:22,552
I had to get
back to the world,
or die trying.

727
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:29,184
I spent the next day
preparing the boat.

728
01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:31,394
I filled my stores
with fresh water...

729
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:34,231
ate seaweed
until my stomach
could take no more...

730
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:36,733
and brought
as many MEERKATS
as I could fit

731
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:39,903
into the storage locker
for Richard Parker.

732
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:43,156
I couldn't leave
without him, of course.

733
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:45,158
It would mean
killing him.

734
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:49,871
And so,
I waited for his return.

735
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:53,917
I knew
he wouldn't be late.

736
01:42:54,085 --> 01:42:57,587
Richard Parker!

737
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:12,435
No one has seen that
floating island since.

738
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:15,897
And you won't read
about those trees
in any nature book.

739
01:43:16,065 --> 01:43:20,110
And yet, if I hadn't
found those shores,
I would have died.

740
01:43:20,278 --> 01:43:22,612
If I hadn't
discovered that tooth,

741
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:25,782
I would have been lost,
alone forever.

742
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:28,451
Even when God seemed
to have abandoned me...

743
01:43:28,619 --> 01:43:30,120
He was watching.

744
01:43:30,288 --> 01:43:33,081
Even when He seemed
indifferent to my
suffering...

745
01:43:33,249 --> 01:43:34,708
He was watching.

746
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:38,712
And when I was
beyond all hope of saving,
He gave me rest...

747
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:41,965
then gave me a sign
to continue my journey.

748
01:43:54,812 --> 01:43:57,355
By the time we reached
the Mexican shore,

749
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,233
I was afraid to
let go of the boat.

750
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:04,154
My strength was gone.
I was so weak.

751
01:44:04,322 --> 01:44:08,116
I was afraid that
in two feet of water,
so close to deliverance...

752
01:44:08,284 --> 01:44:10,327
I would drown.

753
01:44:19,587 --> 01:44:23,590
I struggled to shore
and fell upon the sand.

754
01:44:23,758 --> 01:44:25,508
It was warm and soft...

755
01:44:25,676 --> 01:44:28,970
like pressing my face
against the cheek of God.

756
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:34,351
And somewhere,
two eyes were smiling
at having me there.

757
01:44:38,356 --> 01:44:42,108
I was so spent,
I could hardly move.

758
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:51,284
And so, Richard Parker
went ahead of me.

759
01:44:52,662 --> 01:44:56,706
He stretched his legs
and walked along the shore.

760
01:45:00,461 --> 01:45:03,713
At the edge of the jungle,
he stopped.

761
01:45:03,881 --> 01:45:06,341
I was certain
he was going to
look back at me...

762
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:09,719
flatten his ears
to his head, growl.

763
01:45:09,887 --> 01:45:13,973
That he would
bring our relationship
to an end in some way.

764
01:45:15,893 --> 01:45:19,062
But he just stared ahead
into the jungle.

765
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:25,235
And then, Richard Parker,
my fierce companion...

766
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:28,071
the terrible one
who kept me alive...

767
01:45:30,866 --> 01:45:34,494
disappeared
forever from my life.

768
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:44,003
After a few hours,
a member of my own
species found me.

769
01:45:44,505 --> 01:45:47,590
He left and
returned with a group
who carried me away.

770
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,053
I wept like a child.

771
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:56,558
Not because I was overwhelmed
at having survived,
although I was.

772
01:45:57,435 --> 01:46:03,606
I was weeping
because Richard Parker
left me so unceremoniously.

773
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:07,610
It broke my heart.

774
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:15,952
You know,
my father was right.

775
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,872
Richard Parker never
saw me as his friend.

776
01:46:19,457 --> 01:46:23,376
After all
we had been through,
he didn't even look back.

777
01:46:24,545 --> 01:46:26,565
But I have to believe
there was more in his
eyes...

778
01:46:26,589 --> 01:46:29,591
than my own reflection
staring back at me.

779
01:46:29,759 --> 01:46:32,051
I know it.
I felt it.

780
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:35,138
Even if I can't prove it.

781
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:41,936
You know,
I've left so much behind.

782
01:46:42,104 --> 01:46:45,482
My family, the zoo,
India, Anandi.

783
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:49,903
I suppose, in the end,
the whole of life becomes
an act of letting go.

784
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:53,490
But what always
hurts the most...

785
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:57,285
is not taking a moment
to say goodbye.

786
01:46:58,996 --> 01:47:03,166
I was never able
to thank my father
for all I learned from him.

787
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:06,336
To tell him,
without his lessons...

788
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,172
I would never
have survived.

789
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:14,969
I know Richard Parker
is a tiger,
but I wish I had said...

790
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:17,806
"It's over.
We survived."

791
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:21,768
"Thank you
for saving my life.
I love you, Richard Parker."

792
01:47:21,936 --> 01:47:24,646
"You will always
be with me."

793
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,525
"May God be with you ."

794
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:38,034
I don't know
what to say.

795
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:46,960
It's hard to believe,
isn't it?

796
01:47:49,964 --> 01:47:52,173
It is a lot to take in.

797
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:55,301
To figure out
what it all means.

798
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:56,636
If it happened,
it happened.

799
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,305
Why should it have
to mean anything?

800
01:48:00,850 --> 01:48:03,810
Some of it is
pretty incredible.

801
01:48:03,978 --> 01:48:06,312
See, I was the only one
who survived the shipwreck.

802
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:10,066
So the Japanese
shipping company sent
two men to talk to me...

803
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:13,069
in the Mexican hospital
where I was recovering.

804
01:48:15,155 --> 01:48:17,073
I still have a copy
of their report.

805
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:22,328
They had insurance claims
to settle...

806
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:25,415
and they wanted to find out
why the ship sank.

807
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:27,876
They didn't
believe me, either.

808
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:34,841
Thousands of MEERKATS
on a floating
carnivorous island...

809
01:48:35,009 --> 01:48:36,926
and no one
has ever seen it?

810
01:48:37,094 --> 01:48:39,888
Yes, just like I told you.

811
01:48:40,055 --> 01:48:41,764
Bananas don't float.

812
01:48:41,932 --> 01:48:43,433
Why are you
talking about bananas?

813
01:48:43,601 --> 01:48:46,269
You said the orangutan
floated to you
on a bundle of bananas.

814
01:48:46,437 --> 01:48:48,271
But bananas don't float.

815
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:49,772
Are you sure about that?

816
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:52,442
Of course they do.
Try it for yourself.

817
01:48:53,402 --> 01:48:57,572
In any case, we are not here
to talk about bananas
or MEERKATS.

818
01:48:57,740 --> 01:49:01,075
Look, I've just
told you a long story
and I'm very tired.

819
01:49:01,243 --> 01:49:06,122
We are here because
a Japanese cargo ship
sank in the Pacific.

820
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:08,750
Something I never forget.

821
01:49:09,919 --> 01:49:12,378
I lost my whole family.

822
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:18,801
Get him some water.

823
01:49:21,263 --> 01:49:23,473
We don't mean
to push you.

824
01:49:24,558 --> 01:49:27,435
And you have our
deepest sympathies.

825
01:49:27,603 --> 01:49:29,604
But we have come
a long way...

826
01:49:29,772 --> 01:49:32,941
and we are no closer
to understanding
why the ship sank.

827
01:49:33,108 --> 01:49:35,234
Because I don't know.

828
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:36,945
I was asleep.
Something woke me up.

829
01:49:37,112 --> 01:49:39,656
It could have
been an explosion,
I can't be sure.

830
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:41,741
And then the ship sank.

831
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:43,952
What else do you
want from me?

832
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:46,412
A story that won't make us
look like fools.

833
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:49,582
We need a simpler story
for our report.

834
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:51,918
One our company
can understand.

835
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:54,671
A story
we can all believe.

836
01:49:57,508 --> 01:50:00,510
So, a story without things
you've never seen before.

837
01:50:01,011 --> 01:50:02,345
That's right.

838
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:06,683
Without surprises.
Without animals
or islands.

839
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:09,519
Yes. The truth.

840
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:20,863
So, what did you do?

841
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:27,370
I told them
another story.

842
01:50:28,205 --> 01:50:29,372
Four of us survived.

843
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:32,792
The cook and the sailor
were already aboard.

844
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:35,063
The cook threw me a lifebuoy
and pulled me aboard...

845
01:50:35,087 --> 01:50:38,631
and Mother held on to
some bananas and made it
to the lifeboat.

846
01:50:40,217 --> 01:50:43,219
The cook was
a disgusting man.

847
01:50:43,387 --> 01:50:45,596
He ate a rat.

848
01:50:45,764 --> 01:50:48,891
We had food enough for weeks,
but he found the rat
in the first few days...

849
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:52,729
and he killed it,
dried it in the sun
and ate it.

850
01:50:52,896 --> 01:50:55,106
He was such a brute,
that man.

851
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,235
But he was resourceful.

852
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:03,573
It was his idea to build
the raft to catch fish.

853
01:51:03,741 --> 01:51:06,951
We would have died in
those first few days
without him.

854
01:51:09,246 --> 01:51:13,750
The sailor was the same man
who brought rice and gravy,
the Buddhist.

855
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:17,295
We didn't understand
much of what he said,
only that he was suffering.

856
01:51:17,755 --> 01:51:19,922
He had broken his leg
horribly in the fall.

857
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:23,176
We tried to set it
as best we could, but
the leg became infected...

858
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:28,097
and the cook said that
we had to do something
or he'd die.

859
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:29,640
The cook said
he'd do it,

860
01:51:29,767 --> 01:51:32,101
but Mother and I had
to hold the man down.

861
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:34,771
And I believed him,
we needed to do it.

862
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:37,273
So...

863
01:51:38,942 --> 01:51:42,028
I kept saying,
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

864
01:51:42,196 --> 01:51:46,032
And he just
kept looking at me.
His eyes were so...

865
01:51:49,203 --> 01:51:52,663
I'll never
understand the point
of that man's suffering.

866
01:51:53,832 --> 01:51:56,042
I can still hear him.

867
01:51:56,794 --> 01:52:00,463
The happy Buddhist,
he only ate rice and gravy.

868
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:07,720
We didn't save him,
of course.

869
01:52:07,888 --> 01:52:09,305
He died.

870
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:12,550
The morning after,
the cook caught
his first dorado...

871
01:52:12,643 --> 01:52:15,686
and I didn't understand
what he had done at first,
but Mother did...

872
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:18,815
and I had never seen
Mother so angry.

873
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,567
"Stop whining and
be happy," he said.

874
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:24,570
"We need more
food or we'll die.
That was the whole point."

875
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:26,656
"What was the whole point?"
Mother asked.

876
01:52:26,824 --> 01:52:30,910
"You let that poor boy
die in order to get bait,
you monster!"

877
01:52:32,412 --> 01:52:33,579
The cook got furious.

878
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:35,665
He started towards her
with his fist raised...

879
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:38,876
and Mother slapped him hard,
right across the face.

880
01:52:39,044 --> 01:52:40,920
I was stunned.

881
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:43,548
I thought he was going
to kill her right then.

882
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:46,759
But he didn't.

883
01:52:48,679 --> 01:52:51,389
The cook didn't stop
at bait either, no.

884
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:54,183
The sailor...

885
01:52:55,936 --> 01:52:58,271
He went the same
way the rat went.

886
01:53:01,024 --> 01:53:03,526
The cook was
a resourceful man.

887
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:09,866
It was a week later
that he...

888
01:53:11,577 --> 01:53:13,744
Because of me.

889
01:53:13,912 --> 01:53:16,873
Because I couldn't
hold on to a stupid turtle.

890
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:19,917
It slipped out of my hands
and swam away.

891
01:53:20,085 --> 01:53:22,564
And the cook came up
and he punched me on
the side of my head...

892
01:53:22,588 --> 01:53:24,797
and my teeth clacked
and I saw stars.

893
01:53:24,965 --> 01:53:26,276
I thought he was
going to hit me again...

894
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,380
but Mother started
pounding on him
with her fists...

895
01:53:30,387 --> 01:53:31,846
She yelled at me
to go to the raft.

896
01:53:33,765 --> 01:53:36,559
I thought she
was coming with me,
or I'd never have...

897
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:42,106
I don't know why
I didn't make her
go first.

898
01:53:44,109 --> 01:53:46,444
I think about that
every day.

899
01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:56,162
I jumped over
and turned back just
as the knife came out.

900
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:02,585
There wasn't anything
I could do.

901
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:06,422
I couldn't look away.

902
01:54:10,636 --> 01:54:13,095
He threw her body overboard.

903
01:54:14,765 --> 01:54:18,601
And then the sharks came.
And I saw what they...

904
01:54:23,315 --> 01:54:24,941
I saw.

905
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:33,616
The next day,
I killed him.

906
01:54:34,785 --> 01:54:37,620
He didn't even fight back.
He knew he had gone
too far...

907
01:54:37,788 --> 01:54:39,956
even by his
own standards.

908
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:43,376
He'd left the knife
out on the bench,

909
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:46,629
and I did to him what
he did to the sailor.

910
01:54:49,383 --> 01:54:52,635
He was such an evil man,
but worse still, he...

911
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:57,348
He brought
the evil out in me.

912
01:54:58,809 --> 01:55:01,185
And I have to
live with that.

913
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:10,653
I was alone
in a lifeboat...

914
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:14,365
drifting across
the Pacific Ocean.

915
01:55:15,075 --> 01:55:16,909
And I survived.

916
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:25,334
After that,
they had no more
questions.

917
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:29,171
The investigators
didn't seem to like
the story, exactly.

918
01:55:30,007 --> 01:55:34,510
But they thanked me,
they wished me well,
and they left.

919
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:43,352
So the stories...

920
01:55:46,023 --> 01:55:48,399
both the zebra
and the sailor...

921
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,776
broke their leg.

922
01:55:51,194 --> 01:55:54,405
And the hyena
killed the zebra
and the orangutan.

923
01:55:54,865 --> 01:55:58,868
So... the hyena is the cook.

924
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:01,537
The sailor
is the zebra.

925
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:04,582
Your mother
is the orangutan.

926
01:56:04,916 --> 01:56:08,044
And you are...

927
01:56:08,879 --> 01:56:11,297
the tiger.

928
01:56:15,302 --> 01:56:17,094
Can I ask you something?

929
01:56:18,597 --> 01:56:20,431
Of course.

930
01:56:20,599 --> 01:56:24,435
I've told you two stories
about what happened
out on the ocean.

931
01:56:24,603 --> 01:56:27,897
Neither explains what caused
the sinking of the ship...

932
01:56:28,065 --> 01:56:32,234
and no one can prove
which story is true
and which is not.

933
01:56:32,402 --> 01:56:35,738
In both stories,
the ship sinks...

934
01:56:35,906 --> 01:56:38,824
my family dies
and I suffer.

935
01:56:39,284 --> 01:56:40,743
True.

936
01:56:43,288 --> 01:56:45,581
So, which story
do you prefer?

937
01:56:53,090 --> 01:56:55,257
The one with the tiger.

938
01:56:56,259 --> 01:56:58,511
That's the better story.

939
01:57:01,848 --> 01:57:03,599
Thank you.

940
01:57:04,184 --> 01:57:06,602
And so it goes with God.

941
01:57:18,323 --> 01:57:20,157
Mamaji was right.

942
01:57:21,159 --> 01:57:23,452
It's an amazing story.

943
01:57:24,871 --> 01:57:26,789
Will you really
let me write it?

944
01:57:26,957 --> 01:57:28,374
Of course.

945
01:57:28,542 --> 01:57:31,794
Isn't that why Mamaji
sent you here, after all?

946
01:57:35,799 --> 01:57:37,383
My wife is here.

947
01:57:37,551 --> 01:57:39,751
Do you want to
stay for dinner?
She's an incredible cook.

948
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:40,970
I didn't know
you had a wife.

949
01:57:41,138 --> 01:57:43,347
And a cat
and two children.

950
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:46,350
So, your story does
have a happy ending.

951
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:49,478
Well, that's up to you.

952
01:57:49,813 --> 01:57:52,148
The story is yours now.

953
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:08,539
Hmm.

954
01:58:09,541 --> 01:58:13,752
"Mr. Patel's is
an astounding story
of courage and endurance..."

955
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,881
"unparalleled
in the history
of shipwrecks."

956
01:58:17,048 --> 01:58:21,343
"Very few castaways can
claim to have survived
so long at sea..."

957
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:24,054
"and none in the company..."

958
01:58:24,222 --> 01:58:26,891
"of an adult Bengal tiger."

959
01:58:29,352 --> 01:58:30,644
Hi, Dad.

960
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:33,731
We have a guest.
Let me introduce you.

961
01:58:34,608 --> 01:58:35,733
Hi.
Hi.

962
01:58:36,026 --> 01:58:37,276
Nice to meet you.

963
01:58:37,444 --> 01:58:38,694
Adita.

964
01:58:39,696 --> 01:58:40,905
Ravi.
