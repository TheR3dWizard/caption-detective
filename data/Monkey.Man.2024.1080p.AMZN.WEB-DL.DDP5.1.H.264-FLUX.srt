1
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,691
Do you know
the story of Hanuman?

2
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:11,829
Mm-mm.

3
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:13,107
No?

4
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:15,247
Look at this.

5
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:18,526
Look.

6
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:20,356
The story goes...

7
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:22,565
When Hanuman was little...

8
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:23,980
Very little...

9
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,569
He was very hungry.

10
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:28,157
So hungry.

11
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,295
Just like you!

12
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:35,164
He could have eaten any
fruit in the forest.

13
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:38,339
But something cast
a spell on him.

14
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,894
High above the trees.

15
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:45,035
It was a big juicy mango.

16
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:46,761
So shiny.

17
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:49,419
Look at this.

18
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:50,972
Do you know what he did?

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,220
Hanuman took to the skies.

20
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:01,845
Straight towards that fruit.

21
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:05,263
That juicy mango.

22
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:07,713
So shiny.

23
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:12,856
Only to discover...

24
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:14,789
that it wasn't a mango

25
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:20,140
but the burning, hot sun.

26
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:22,832
The gods heard of this...

27
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,248
and gathered to punish him.

28
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:29,528
They taught him a lesson...

29
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:34,706
and stripped young Hanuman
of his powers.

30
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:39,193
And then what happened, Ma?

31
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:47,339
There are no fucking rules!

32
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:50,170
Fight!

33
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,712
Sir, Tiger, sir.

34
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:55,407
King Kobra!
King Kobra! King Kobra!

35
00:03:56,374 --> 00:03:59,273
Tiger, I love you!

36
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,940
King Kobra! King Kobra!

37
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:05,659
King Kobra! King Kobra!
King Kobra! King Kobra!

38
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:07,350
Whoo!

39
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:09,421
Good evening.

40
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,699
That's what I'm talking about.

41
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:13,943
Welcome to Tiger's Temple.

42
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,635
This is a sacred space.

43
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:19,259
Because some of us here
are Muslim.

44
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:20,846
Some of us are Hindu.

45
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:22,538
Fuck, maybe there's
a closet Christian

46
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:24,816
hiding somewhere there
under the rafters.

47
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:31,788
But we here all worship one god:

48
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:33,756
the Indian rupee!

49
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:44,732
The winner,
the killer of the beast,

50
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,909
King Kobra!

51
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:51,808
Look at this maderchod.
Look at this.

52
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:55,018
That's the smell of victory
right there.

53
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:57,435
Do you smell it?

54
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,885
'Cause I fucking smell it!

55
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:01,991
This is a champion. This is...

56
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:18,792
Fucking hell, guys.
What a night, eh?

57
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:23,037
You hear that?
They fucking hate you.

58
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,315
It's incredible.

59
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:26,765
What a night.

60
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:28,664
Sarishan,
what's this fucking stomach?

61
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,493
Too many samosas.
You're the Lizard King,

62
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:32,530
not the fucking
Samosa King, okay?

63
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:34,186
This fucking tap!

64
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:36,913
Aziz, the fucking tap came off
in my hands again, man.

65
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:37,949
Come here.

66
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,640
Look here. What's that?

67
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:41,791
That fucking stays on. You know
what my water bill is for that?

68
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:42,935
Fix the fucking tap. Please.

69
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:44,645
Aziz, just fix it,
brother. Please.

70
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:46,312
I ask just for a little bit
of fucking cleanliness.

71
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,166
A little bit of
personal hygiene. Yes, what?

72
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:51,134
Yeah. All right.

73
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:54,275
Don't spend it all at once, eh?

74
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,451
Tiger. Tiger, this is half.

75
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,039
What? That's what
you got last time.

76
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:01,455
What, are you saving
for a better place to live?

77
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:02,939
You want another 50%, you bleed.

78
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:05,528
That's why it's called
the bleed bonus.

79
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:09,083
I need that money.

80
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,915
Then dance.

81
00:07:14,054 --> 00:07:15,227
Don't look at me like that.

82
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:16,539
You chose the name.

83
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:17,997
You're like those
little monkeys,

84
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:19,680
you know, in the marketplace
that go...

85
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:21,417
with a little pink skirt.

86
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,718
That's you.

87
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:24,029
Put on a show, get the money.

88
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,567
There's hundreds
of folks out there

89
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:27,101
that'll do this, eh... hundreds...

90
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:31,036
waiting to take your place
if this isn't for you.

91
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,939
To live eternal,
and gain immortality.

92
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:38,941
A sacred gift of the Gods,
from Baba Shakti.

93
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,012
<i>Baba Shakti.</i>

94
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,049
<i>Guru, man of peace,
the nation's lion.</i>

95
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:46,776
<i>Born to poverty
but not held captive by it.</i>

96
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:49,365
<i>Indeed, Baba Shakti is now
likely to be seen</i>

97
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,918
<i>in the temples of the elite</i>

98
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:52,748
<i>than at the temples
of the gods,</i>

99
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,991
<i>rubbing shoulders
with the rich and powerful.</i>

100
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,753
<i>Are these the simple actions
of a man made good...</i>

101
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:00,065
I leave politics
to the politicians.

102
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:02,319
<i>...or the start
of a push for political power</i>

103
00:08:02,343 --> 00:08:04,069
<i>through his endorsement
of the controversial</i>

104
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:05,381
<i>Sovereign Party?</i>

105
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,383
If I see a God-fearing man

106
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,075
who is doing good for India,
I will support him.

107
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:12,664
<i>He has dismissed
rumors that his factory...</i>

108
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:14,390
Lucky, how's things?

109
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,530
First class, bro.

110
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:18,843
Boss, get him a Mango Frooti.

111
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,017
Eh! Make it a double.

112
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:23,572
So?

113
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,616
Lucky, Lucky, Lucky.

114
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:41,590
This is who you want.

115
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:44,489
Queenie Kapoor,
the queen of Kings.

116
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:47,803
Friday afternoon,
she had a massage

117
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,702
and pedicure at Body Tonic.

118
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,186
Most of the mornings,

119
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,741
she stops at a Café d'Italia
for coffee.

120
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,466
- D'Italia?
- Yeah.

121
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:58,986
She'll be there tomorrow.

122
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:01,471
But good luck
getting anything out of her.

123
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,887
She's a real hard-ass.

124
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,385
- Ayurvedic wisdom
- Okay.

125
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,929
- is thousands of years old.
- Good job.

126
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:14,208
Who are we to question the gods?

127
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:20,318
Vishnu, Lakshmi,
Shiva! For fifty rupees.

128
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:23,321
Yes.
On the dinner table, it was like

129
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,012
a verbal contract.

130
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:29,430
I don't have any mail.

131
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,729
Please, madam,
I haven't eaten in two days.

132
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,296
Please, please, madam.

133
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:36,299
Please, please, madam.

134
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:38,519
I'm... Ow! -

135
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:41,960
Oh, my God. How can you allow
these guys here?

136
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:43,962

00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,218
Where did you find this?

165
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:46,533
Some men were fighting
over it next to, uh, JV Road

166
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:48,328
near Café d'Italia.

167
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:51,849
I tried to rush in,
and, uh, um...

168
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:54,092
they fought back and, uh...

169
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,715
- Take this.
- I-I...

170
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:57,924
I don't...
I don't want charity.

171
00:11:58,062 --> 00:12:01,859
Wh-What I need is a... is a job.

172
00:12:01,997 --> 00:12:03,274
This is Kings.

173
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:05,103
We just don't hire
off the street.

174
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:06,484
Where's your references?

175
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:10,212
Your CV? Hmm?

176
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,559
Look, I don't have time
for all this.

177
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:14,354
Take it and go.

178
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:17,460
This.

179
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:20,740
There's my CV.

180
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:22,258
That's bleach.

181
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:25,296
Chemical, oil.

182
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:29,058
Give me the job
no one wants to do.

183
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:31,681
I'll do it.

184
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,925
No complaint.

185
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:37,032
This is all I know.

186
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:52,944
Yeah.

187
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:54,946
No. Uh, no, no. Listen.

188
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:58,018
I actually liked this one
from Indonesia.

189
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:00,469
Is she broken in?

190
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:03,852
No, th-that's fine, but I just
want to know if, uh...

191
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,577
How quickly
can we get her papers?

192
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:07,890
Hmm?

193
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:25,874
Anyone who talks
outside these walls,

194
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:28,428
anyone who forgets their place,

195
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:31,017
it doesn't turn out well
for them.

196
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:34,227
Understood?

197
00:13:36,022 --> 00:13:37,437
Understood.

198
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:52,038
Once more.

199
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:55,248
Oh God, I worship you.

200
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,734
I only worship you.

201
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,461
You are the most powerful one.

202
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:03,981
You are my saviour.

203
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:07,916
I only worship you.

204
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:14,267
You make us smile
and fill our hearts with love.

205
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:17,166
With our eyes, with our ears.

206
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:20,204
On our lips, we say your name.

207
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:25,071
I sing your praise,
day and night.

208
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:29,799
I worship you.

209
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:49,474
New guy, huh?

210
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,512
What's your name?

211
00:14:55,446 --> 00:14:56,826
Bobby.

212
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:58,173
Hmm.

213
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:08,148
Wear your cap properly.

214
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:11,186
We don't want one of your pubes
in the curry...

215
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:14,810
Bobby.

216
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,570
I think we met before, right?

217
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,952
I-I don't think so.

218
00:15:19,815 --> 00:15:22,335
You like tequila, huh, Bobby?

219
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:27,029
Patrón, Don Julio, the one with
George Clooney in the photo?

220
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,858
I just want to clean
the dishes, okay?

221
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:30,584
Coke? Morphine? MDMA?

222
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,587
Oi, Alphonso, eh,
I've told you many times

223
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:34,934
to stop hassling my staff.

224
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:37,177
Quality control, man.

225
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:40,111
You're gonna thank me
for this one day.

226
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,219
Stay cool, Bobby.

227
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:46,497
Stay cool, hmm?

228
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:50,950
Watch my fucking leg, man.

229
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,259
One regular paan.

230
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:38,514
And a Raju Special.

231
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,108
Lion!

232
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:47,729
Yes.

233
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,663
Take him.

234
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,113
Can I go on his shoulders?

235
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:53,495
How about a rickshaw,
little bastard? Take him!

236
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:56,705
Solid.

237
00:16:56,843 --> 00:16:58,465
Come.

238
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:22,351
What you got?

239
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:25,182
Paan.

240
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:27,148
Get inside.

241
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:42,233
Is this all you got?

242
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:44,994
Yeah.

243
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,623
Are you sure?

244
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:56,799
'Cause I got an answer
to every prayer.

245
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,803
You like <i>John Wick?</i>
'Cause this just came in.

246
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:04,083
Yeah.

247
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,085
The TTI.

248
00:18:06,223 --> 00:18:08,190
Same gun from the movie.

249
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:10,641
But made in China.

250
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:14,334
Boom.

251
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:18,821
I want something small
but effective.

252
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:21,238
...38 caliber revolver.

253
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:24,965
It's a little bit heavy,
but it's got a lot of thump.

254
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,244
You need to be pretty close.

255
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:30,592
Close is good.

256
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:36,184
I'll take it.

257
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:41,568
Staff entrance. Copy.

258
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:43,881
Copy. Staff entrance secured.

259
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,440
Huh?

260
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:53,349
You want to go
back to selling your ass

261
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:54,754
on the street for 500 rupees?

262
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:57,136
I brought you in,
and this is how you repay me?

263
00:18:57,274 --> 00:18:58,585
Huh?

264
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:00,449
Okay, okay. Don't cry.

265
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:02,106
Don't cry.

266
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:05,592
As soon as Dr. Irani's back,
we'll take care of it.

267
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,835
Yeah?

268
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:09,562
You're fucking killing me,
Rahul.

269
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,978
No, no, no. Uh-uh.

270
00:19:12,116 --> 00:19:13,428
Listen to me...

271
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:15,878
You call Evgeni
and tell that motherfucker

272
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:18,502
to find another source.

273
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:20,573
I made you!

274
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:22,413
Now you think you can sit on
my shoulders and piss in my ear?

275
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:23,966
They're fuck all. Fuck all.

276
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,819
Fuck all.
You understand "fuck all"?

277
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:28,684
No, no, no. No, no.
Listen, listen.

278
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:31,066
I have a reputation to protect,
understand?

279
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,412
What the fuck is your problem?

280
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,000
How many times
do I have to tell you

281
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:36,218
fucking knock on the door
and enter...

282
00:19:36,347 --> 00:19:37,659
Sorry.
Nishit said you needed me.

283
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:39,437
I need you
to learn some manners,

284
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:40,938
you inbred little goat fucker.

285
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:43,872
Rahul,
I'll have to call you back.

286
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,494
Listen, go to Naqeeb

287
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:46,989
and pick up some
Kashmiri snowflake.

288
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:49,636
Good stuff, okay?
None of that cheap shit.

289
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:51,934
But the problem is, uh,
quality control, it's no good.

290
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:53,813
Naqeeb has some issue with me,
you know?

291
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:55,722
I don't know whether it's
the Christian-Muslim thing

292
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:57,126
- or what, but...
- Hey.

293
00:19:57,265 --> 00:20:00,233
You. Face the wall.

294
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:06,584
What the fuck
are you talking about?

295
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:08,631
Tell Naqeeb, if the maal is good,

296
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:11,348
we'll buy some more
for Chief Rana.

297
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:14,143
Get it sorted by the weekend.

298
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:16,353
He is coming with his boys.

299
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:18,044
- Hey, Alphonso.
- Hmm?

300
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:20,333
Only the best to serve the VIPs.

301
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:22,497
Yeah. Got it.

302
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:26,259
Alphonso. Alphonso.

303
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:29,918
Hey, uh, good job with Queenie,
huh? She really respects you.

304
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:31,056
What do you want?

305
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,543
Um, look, if you... if you...

306
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:36,349
Look, if you need any help
with the VIPs...

307
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:37,891
Hey, new guy...

308
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,239
You know what happens
to earwigs around here?

309
00:20:40,377 --> 00:20:42,009
You hear nothing,
you see nothing. Got it?

310
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,208
Look, I'm just saying,
if you need someone to go in

311
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:45,634
- and do the job...
- Does it look like

312
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:47,083
I need some help
from someone like you?

313
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:48,143
- Hey.
- Is there so...

314
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,282
What the fuck, man?

315
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,697
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

316
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:53,804
Look, you want to make
some money?

317
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:56,220
Guaranteed?

318
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:57,911
- Go on.
- Okay.

319
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:00,500
Uh...

320
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:03,123
come to this place tonight.

321
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:08,577
Bet on Khan.
You'll make a killing.

322
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,445
How the fuck do you know?

323
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:17,690
I-I'll be fighting him.

324
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,318
Fuck off.

325
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:27,872
The monkey will win
the first two rounds

326
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,461
and go down in the third.

327
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,325
What's in it for you?

328
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:33,809

The boss of the bosses.

393
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,924
He runs everything
in this town, man.

394

434
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:55,648

over here who knows...

443
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:17,739

444

Not here, baby.

457

Nothing will happen.
Don't lose heart.

458

give you this land!

That's good. You like that?

473
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:38,975
She'd better.

474
00:30:39,113 --> 00:30:41,356
It's 4,000 rupees a plate.

475
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:55,060
This is not the place to work

476
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:57,269
if you can't handle
that sort of stuff.

477
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:08,590

483

expecting more.

Sit. Sit. Sit.

487
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:21,008

488
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:24,080
- For the dog.
- Come on, man. Let's boogie.

489
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:33,192

00:55:55,455 --> 00:55:57,802
Both.

658
00:56:01,254 --> 00:56:04,188
Some people find that...

659
00:56:04,326 --> 00:56:05,879
strange.

660
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:11,678
But we hijras understand it
completely.

661
00:56:13,715 --> 00:56:15,061
Who are you?

662
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:20,031
I'm Alpha,
the keeper of the temple.

663
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,795
Careful! Careful!

664
00:56:32,734 --> 00:56:34,667
Why did you help me?

665
00:56:34,805 --> 00:56:38,049
You should've died
from those injuries.

666
00:56:39,603 --> 00:56:42,433
The gods must have
a greater plan for you.

667
00:56:44,573 --> 00:56:47,611
We all have scars.

668
00:56:51,718 --> 00:56:53,651
I should go.

669
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:55,757
No. I wouldn't do that.

670
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:58,104
The police are looking for you.

671
00:56:58,242 --> 00:56:59,864
All over town.

672
00:57:00,002 --> 00:57:02,177
But not here.

673
00:57:03,696 --> 00:57:05,663
They find us too...

674
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:08,942
unsettling.

675
00:57:11,048 --> 00:57:13,015
Stay with us.

676
00:57:13,153 --> 00:57:14,983
Rest.

677
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:17,848
You need to heal.

678
00:57:21,092 --> 00:57:24,026
Maybe she'll speak to you.

679
00:57:31,655 --> 00:57:34,209
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

680
00:57:34,347 --> 00:57:38,213
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

681
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:41,319
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

682
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:45,220
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

683
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:47,878
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

684
00:57:48,016 --> 00:57:53,055
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!
Shakti! Shakti!

685
00:58:09,624 --> 00:58:11,902
Who is he?

686
00:58:13,144 --> 00:58:14,939
He's a nobody.

687
00:58:15,077 --> 00:58:18,218
Just some crazy kid
from the gutter.

688
00:58:18,356 --> 00:58:21,359
People once said that about me.

689
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,500
And now look at you.

690
00:58:23,638 --> 00:58:26,157
You're the nation's lion.

691
00:58:28,056 --> 00:58:30,817
You said he spoke of his mother.

692
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:34,649
Don't worry about him...

693
00:58:34,787 --> 00:58:37,583
He's a walking corpse.

694
00:58:39,274 --> 00:58:40,309
Rana...

695
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,762
in the great tapestry of life,

696
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:49,664
just one small ember
can burn down everything.

697
00:58:50,665 --> 00:58:53,495
The very idea of him

698
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:55,877
has to be extinguished.

699
00:58:57,603 --> 00:58:59,052
Find him.

700
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:03,125
Before your nobody
becomes a somebody.

701
00:59:09,476 --> 00:59:12,065
The trail of destruction
started with a murder attempt

702
00:59:12,203 --> 00:59:15,379
on Yatana's chief of police,
Rana Singh,

703
00:59:15,517 --> 00:59:18,175
by a terrorist
posing as a member of staff.

704
00:59:18,313 --> 00:59:20,798
A citywide manhunt is underway
for the terrorist

705
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:23,387
and his known associates.

706
00:59:23,525 --> 00:59:26,217
Security has been raised
for the upcoming elections,

707
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:30,014
which are occurring on the
country's most auspicious day.

708
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:07,017
- Thank you.
- So, uh...

709
01:00:07,155 --> 01:00:11,090
This one is
a story of husband and wife...

710
01:00:11,228 --> 01:00:12,228
Husband.

711
01:00:13,471 --> 01:00:14,437
And wife.

712
01:00:33,215 --> 01:00:35,839
Now they are okay.

713
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:40,947
But...

714
01:00:52,234 --> 01:00:55,444
And that is why
she ran away with the priest.

715
01:01:07,836 --> 01:01:09,735
Funny, huh?

716
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:33,482
Still can't sleep?

717
01:01:35,657 --> 01:01:37,452
I never sleep.

718
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:40,973
Voices in your head?

719
01:01:42,388 --> 01:01:44,217
Just one.

720
01:01:47,324 --> 01:01:48,877
Her scream.

721
01:01:51,846 --> 01:01:54,089
It's been inside me
my whole life.

722
01:01:58,818 --> 01:02:00,855
Come with me.

723
01:02:31,402 --> 01:02:35,510
We were warriors before
they drove us into exile here.

724
01:02:37,512 --> 01:02:40,170
The Vedas speak of a tree

725
01:02:40,308 --> 01:02:43,311
that was supposedly planted
by Lord Shiva,

726
01:02:45,071 --> 01:02:47,798
the destroyer of worlds.

727
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,926
I was once like you.

728
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:14,514
A broken man.

729
01:03:16,344 --> 01:03:19,243
A slave to childhood terrors.

730
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:25,525
I learned that you need
to destroy in order to grow.

731
01:03:26,664 --> 01:03:29,046
To create space for new life.

732
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:39,125
Mm. Here we go.

733
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:43,336
Within its root lies
a potent toxin.

734
01:03:43,474 --> 01:03:47,168
We call it Trishul
after Shiva's trident.

735
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:50,999
It will cut you open.

736
01:03:52,483 --> 01:03:57,972
Only a weakened man
can benefit from this.

737
01:03:59,111 --> 01:04:02,562
Only a strong man
can survive it.

738
01:04:05,082 --> 01:04:07,188
Are you ready?

739
01:04:08,672 --> 01:04:10,329
Yes.

740
01:04:28,002 --> 01:04:29,244
The pain...

741
01:04:30,797 --> 01:04:34,249
It will leave you once
it's finished teaching you.

742
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:02,915
Brothers and Sisters!

743
01:07:03,053 --> 01:07:05,297
Welcome to the tale
of the Ramayana.

744
01:07:05,435 --> 01:07:07,644
In each generation,
the story repeats itself.

745
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:13,546
The captive Princess...

746
01:07:13,684 --> 01:07:16,239
And her fight
with the Demon King.

747
01:07:17,964 --> 01:07:19,173
I'm Ravan!

748
01:07:19,311 --> 01:07:22,900
Evil King, please let me go.

749
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,488
Nobody says no to me!

750
01:07:28,665 --> 01:07:30,218
But then!

751
01:07:30,356 --> 01:07:31,668
And then came the mighty one!

752
01:07:31,806 --> 01:07:33,842
- Mum, that's Hanuman!
- Yes, it is.

753
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,913
Take the first blow of my club.

754
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,169
Feel my monkey strength!

755
01:07:50,307 --> 01:07:52,620
I'm Hanuman!

756
01:08:01,836 --> 01:08:03,251
Speak.

757
01:08:04,183 --> 01:08:06,841
Go Rana, go.

758
01:08:07,531 --> 01:08:10,293
Time to do God's work.

759
01:08:22,822 --> 01:08:25,308
They're back.
The Police are back.

760
01:08:25,446 --> 01:08:27,758
Get up. Run, everyone.

761
01:08:28,207 --> 01:08:30,140
Hurry, hurry.

762
01:08:30,278 --> 01:08:32,522
Run! We must evacuate.
It's the Police.

763
01:09:05,555 --> 01:09:06,935
Listen to me.

764
01:09:07,073 --> 01:09:10,076
You go upstairs and hide.
And don't make a sound.

765
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:12,148
No, no, listen to me.
Listen to me.

766
01:09:12,286 --> 01:09:15,151
Go upstairs and hide. And don't
even make a slight sound.

767
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:16,497
But what about you?

768
01:09:16,635 --> 01:09:18,084
Nothing will happen to me.

769
01:09:18,223 --> 01:09:19,603
Like how a mouse hides?

770
01:09:19,741 --> 01:09:22,296
You hide like a mouse
and make no sound.

771
01:09:22,434 --> 01:09:23,607
Do you trust Mum?

772
01:09:23,745 --> 01:09:25,161
Do you trust me?

773
01:09:25,299 --> 01:09:26,645
Nothing will happen.

774
01:09:26,783 --> 01:09:29,234
Nothing will happen.
Don't lose heart.

775
01:09:29,372 --> 01:09:30,856
Don't lose heart.

776
01:09:30,994 --> 01:09:32,513
You are my Hanuman.

777
01:09:34,687 --> 01:09:35,723
Quickly.

778
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,867
Quickly, quickly.

779
01:10:04,993 --> 01:10:06,823
You've built a sweet home.

780
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:10,965
What were you saying outside?

781
01:10:13,105 --> 01:10:14,520
Huh?

782
01:10:14,658 --> 01:10:17,074
Shove those papers up your ass.

783
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,317
Is that right?

784
01:10:41,133 --> 01:10:42,721
Bloody whore!

785
01:10:44,826 --> 01:10:46,897
You'll shove it up my ass, huh?

786
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:50,246
I'll show you.

787
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:51,592
Get up, bitch.

788
01:13:06,002 --> 01:13:07,866
I failed her.

789
01:13:10,489 --> 01:13:12,180
No.

790
01:13:13,803 --> 01:13:16,046
You tried to save her.

791
01:13:20,085 --> 01:13:21,983
You see scars.

792
01:13:24,089 --> 01:13:28,611
I see the courage of a child
fighting to save his mother.

793
01:13:29,853 --> 01:13:33,719
These are the hands of a warrior

794
01:13:33,857 --> 01:13:37,343
who's destined
to challenge the gods.

795
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:42,348
All your life, you've been
fighting to feel pain.

796
01:13:42,487 --> 01:13:45,973
You need to fight for a purpose.

797
01:13:46,663 --> 01:13:51,392
Fight... for all of us.

798
01:13:52,255 --> 01:13:56,570
It's time to remember
who you are.

799
01:14:04,163 --> 01:14:05,855
<i>As the Sovereign Party</i>

800
01:14:05,993 --> 01:14:08,202
<i>climbs in the polls,
allegations have surfaced</i>

801
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,894
<i>that you destroyed
200 acres of forestland</i>

802
01:14:11,032 --> 01:14:13,241
<i>to build your mega factory.</i>

803
01:14:13,379 --> 01:14:14,691
It's not a factory.

804
01:14:14,829 --> 01:14:16,106
It's a commune.

805
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:17,901
<i>And what about the farmers</i>

806
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:19,903
<i>that have been displaced?</i>

807
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:21,595
<i>Ah.</i>

808
01:14:21,733 --> 01:14:24,252
<i>The land was barren and empty.</i>

809
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:28,084
Few families who lived there
have joined the cause.

810
01:14:28,222 --> 01:14:30,362
<i>And workers who complain</i>

811
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,260
<i>of horrible working conditions?</i>

812
01:14:32,398 --> 01:14:34,331
<i>They aren't workers.</i>

813
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,610
<i>They are my disciples.</i>

814
01:16:19,644 --> 01:16:21,956
Yeah.

815
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:41,700
Hmm.

816
01:16:49,087 --> 01:16:50,778
Ah.

817
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:21,360
Get up.

818
01:17:25,226 --> 01:17:28,126
A surge of sectarian violence
has exploded around the country

819
01:17:28,264 --> 01:17:31,750
<i>after divisive remarks
made by Adesh Joshi.</i>

820
01:17:31,888 --> 01:17:34,995
<i>International leaders
have condemned the violence</i>

821
01:17:35,133 --> 01:17:37,653
<i>against minorities
but have stopped short</i>

822
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:41,760
<i>of criticizing the candidate
as he climbs in the polls.</i>

823
01:18:13,205 --> 01:18:15,656
<i>Close your eyes,</i>

824
01:18:15,794 --> 01:18:18,970
<i>and you will find yourself</i>

825
01:18:19,108 --> 01:18:22,559
<i>sitting atop a mighty tree.</i>

826
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,701
<i>This is your home.</i>

827
01:18:25,839 --> 01:18:28,324
<i>You are a beast.</i>

828
01:18:29,049 --> 01:18:31,983
<i>Look beneath the surface,</i>

829
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:36,159
<i>and you will see roots
deep under the soil,</i>

830
01:18:36,297 --> 01:18:38,299
<i>reaching far and wide.</i>

831
01:18:38,437 --> 01:18:41,682
<i>These are the roots
of your ancestors,</i>

832
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:43,684
<i>the soul of your mother.</i>

833
01:18:43,822 --> 01:18:45,824
<i>Listen to her.</i>

834
01:18:46,687 --> 01:18:48,654
<i>You have nothing to fear.</i>

835
01:18:48,793 --> 01:18:51,416
<i>You've been here for time.</i>

836
01:19:04,878 --> 01:19:06,983
People of Yatana...

837
01:19:08,329 --> 01:19:09,883
...Baba Shakti!

838
01:19:10,021 --> 01:19:12,057
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

839
01:19:12,195 --> 01:19:15,509
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

840
01:19:15,647 --> 01:19:18,063
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

841
01:19:18,201 --> 01:19:20,548
Shakti! Shakti! Shakti!

842
01:19:20,686 --> 01:19:22,378
I am nobody.

843
01:19:23,034 --> 01:19:24,690
I am nothing.

844
01:19:24,829 --> 01:19:26,416
I didn't choose this path.

845
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:29,903
You chose it for me.

846
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:33,216
Change never comes
without a fight.

847
01:19:34,424 --> 01:19:39,533
I want you to choose
another of God's men.

848
01:19:40,603 --> 01:19:44,676
He's one of us.
He is Adesh Joshi,

849
01:19:44,814 --> 01:19:47,921
leader of Sovereign Party.

850
01:19:48,059 --> 01:19:53,789
He will fight with us,
for us, for you.

851
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:59,656
The working man,
the poor, the sick.

852
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,556
<i>Shower him with your love</i>

853
01:20:02,694 --> 01:20:05,524
<i>and let our voice be heard</i>

854
01:20:05,662 --> 01:20:08,044
<i>throughout the nation.</i>

855
01:20:14,188 --> 01:20:15,672
<i>They have destroyed</i>

856
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,089
<i>our sacred values.</i>

857
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:21,368
<i>They have stolen our homes,</i>

858
01:20:21,506 --> 01:20:24,267
<i>poisoned our children's minds.</i>

859
01:20:25,544 --> 01:20:28,478
<i>They have polluted us
with their symbols,</i>

860
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:31,171
<i>their false idols.</i>

861
01:20:31,309 --> 01:20:33,483
<i>We have been blinded.</i>

862
01:20:34,174 --> 01:20:36,279
<i>Will you stand with us?</i>

863
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,868
<i>Will you bleed with us?</i>

864
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:41,975
<i>Will you?</i>

865
01:20:42,561 --> 01:20:43,561
<i>Will you?</i>

866
01:20:47,014 --> 01:20:49,120
Victory for Mother India.

867
01:20:55,022 --> 01:20:57,991
Victory for Mother India!

868
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:22,532
Lakshmi!

869
01:21:25,466 --> 01:21:27,537
Tell me what happened
to Lakshmi.

870
01:21:27,675 --> 01:21:29,367
- Lakshmi!
- Lakshmi!

871
01:21:29,505 --> 01:21:31,369
- Lakshmi.
- Are you okay, Lakshmi?

872
01:21:31,507 --> 01:21:32,888
What happened? What happened?

873
01:21:33,026 --> 01:21:35,373
These men put a notice
on the door.

874
01:21:35,511 --> 01:21:37,858
She tried to take it down,
but they beat her.

875
01:21:37,996 --> 01:21:40,378
She's not breathing.
Breathe, Lakshmi, breathe.

876
01:21:40,516 --> 01:21:42,114
Did you see?
Did you see who it was?

877
01:21:42,138 --> 01:21:43,450
Shakti's men.

878
01:21:43,588 --> 01:21:46,039
They said the temple
never belonged to us.

879
01:21:46,177 --> 01:21:48,489
Alpha, where will we go?

880
01:21:48,627 --> 01:21:51,320
If we don't have money,
they will keep doing this.

881
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:54,979
We cannot pay off some thugs.

882
01:21:55,807 --> 01:21:57,705
We all must pray.

883
01:21:57,843 --> 01:21:59,535
Lakshmi!

884
01:22:00,156 --> 01:22:01,606
God has a plan.

885
01:22:55,901 --> 01:22:57,901
We have the
election results due to break

886
01:22:57,938 --> 01:22:59,319
during Diwali festival.

887
01:22:59,457 --> 01:23:01,193
Sovereign Party supporters
are flooding the streets

888
01:23:01,217 --> 01:23:04,082
with the party expecting
a landslide victory.

From His Majesty

916
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:24,093
all the way to the deepest,
darkest jungles

917
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:26,820
of my mother Africa...

918
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:29,995
I hunted him down.

919
01:24:30,134 --> 01:24:32,101
I...

920
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,345
...darted him myself,

923
01:24:39,488 --> 01:24:41,869
He's evil.

He's ferocious.

925
01:24:44,562 --> 01:24:47,979

these two animals fight?

929

The snake and the monkey.

01:25:26,086 --> 01:25:27,777
- Hey.
- What's going on?

936
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,541
Did he fucking knock him out?

937
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:35,337
Kobra, get up.

938
01:25:37,235 --> 01:25:39,479
You get him fucking up
right now.

939
01:25:42,102 --> 01:25:43,345
I will fuck...

940
01:25:43,483 --> 01:25:47,383
Grab his arms and take him off.

941
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:02,881
Wow, eh?

942
01:26:03,019 --> 01:26:06,264
Wow.

943
01:26:08,024 --> 01:26:10,786
That was a surprise.

944
01:26:15,308 --> 01:26:19,553
Fucking lucky kick, eh?

945
01:26:21,003 --> 01:26:23,764
Looks like we got
a cheeky little monkey

946
01:26:23,902 --> 01:26:25,421
on our hands tonight.

947
01:26:25,559 --> 01:26:27,043

01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,977
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!

Bhalu the Bear!

953
01:26:55,244 --> 01:26:56,487
Fuck him up.

954
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:57,905
Fucking smash his head in, okay?

955
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,904
Get in there
and fucking pummel him.

956
01:27:00,042 --> 01:27:01,285
Go. Go.

957
01:27:01,423 --> 01:27:03,425
Fuck him up.

958
01:27:16,852 --> 01:27:18,992
Smack him in the fucking cock!

959
01:27:31,867 --> 01:27:32,868
Come on!

960
01:27:38,114 --> 01:27:39,184
Drill him!

961
01:27:39,323 --> 01:27:41,773
Drill his fucking skull in!

962
01:27:43,188 --> 01:27:44,776
Drill him in the fucking face!

963
01:27:49,678 --> 01:27:51,887
Go on, smack him, Bhalu!

964
01:27:52,025 --> 01:27:53,751
Come on, then!

965
01:28:06,729 --> 01:28:09,974
Go on, Monkey Man! Yes!

966

Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

989

Monkey Man!
Monkey Man! Monkey Man!

990

Alpha.

991
01:29:50,143 --> 01:29:51,558
Take a look.

992
01:29:51,696 --> 01:29:53,905
What is that?

993
01:29:56,045 --> 01:29:58,082
Take a look.

994
01:30:00,256 --> 01:30:02,569
- There's a note.
- There's a note.

995
01:30:04,433 --> 01:30:05,607
Oh, my God.

996
01:30:05,745 --> 01:30:07,125
Oh, my, my.

997
01:30:07,263 --> 01:30:09,265
I mean, look at this.

998
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,336
Whoa.

999
01:30:11,475 --> 01:30:13,304
- Who sent us this?
- Wow.

1000
01:30:13,442 --> 01:30:15,789
It's money.

1001
01:31:07,703 --> 01:31:09,256
Baba!

1002
01:31:09,394 --> 01:31:12,501
Baba! Baba!

1003
01:31:46,362 --> 01:31:50,366
Baba Shakti! Baba Shakti!

1004
01:32:09,316 --> 01:32:12,147
Baba Shakti! Baba Shakti!

1005
01:32:12,285 --> 01:32:16,772
Baba Shakti! Baba Shakti!
Baba Shakti!

1006
01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:20,155
Baba Shakti! Baba Shakti!

1007
01:32:22,433 --> 01:32:25,194
Listen up, everyone,
if anybody fucks up tonight,

1008
01:32:25,332 --> 01:32:28,577
if anybody messes up,
if I get a single complaint,

1009
01:32:28,715 --> 01:32:30,372
I'll fuck your happiness.

1010
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:35,170
Stop staring at me!
First course out right now!

1011
01:32:36,205 --> 01:32:37,862
It's brilliant. Very good.

1012
01:32:39,968 --> 01:32:41,728
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

1013
01:32:41,866 --> 01:32:43,454
Thank you.

1014
01:32:43,592 --> 01:32:47,527
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an honor it is to be here

1015
01:32:47,665 --> 01:32:51,738
with the Sovereign Party on the
cusp of our historic victory.

1016
01:32:51,876 --> 01:32:54,465
One day, the maharajas
on these walls

1017
01:32:54,603 --> 01:32:56,709
will be replaced with portraits

1018
01:32:56,847 --> 01:32:59,332
of each and every one of you.

1019
01:33:06,408 --> 01:33:08,824
Hey, smart-ass.

1020
01:33:10,688 --> 01:33:11,689
Staff entrance.

1021
01:33:27,153 --> 01:33:30,915
We will rid Mother India
of her scars

1022
01:33:31,053 --> 01:33:34,056
and make her beautiful
once more.

1023
01:33:36,231 --> 01:33:37,991
<i>I would like to acknowledge</i>

1024

Rana Singh.

1026
01:33:43,065 --> 01:33:46,448
His courage and integrity

1027
01:33:46,586 --> 01:33:49,382
<i>has led to Yatana's
lowest crime rate.</i>

we would not be here.

I'm gonna blow your fucking...

1058

Finally out of your tree, huh?

1059
01:42:28,072 --> 01:42:30,144
Get up.

1060
01:42:55,893 --> 01:43:00,243
Did your mother
send you back for more, huh?

1061
01:43:39,903 --> 01:43:41,767
Get up, motherfucker!

1062
01:43:50,293 --> 01:43:51,949
You son of a whore.

1063
01:43:54,089 --> 01:43:55,470
What are you looking at?

1064
01:46:04,081 --> 01:46:05,566
Get up!

1065
01:47:19,950 --> 01:47:22,574
Welcome, Queenie.

1066
01:48:30,365 --> 01:48:32,022
So, you are the one?

1067
01:48:39,616 --> 01:48:41,929
Look at them all.

1068
01:48:42,067 --> 01:48:43,240
Diwali.

1069
01:48:43,378 --> 01:48:47,521
The triumph of light
over darkness.

1070
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:51,697
The defeat of Ravan.

1071
01:48:52,318 --> 01:48:55,218
But Ravan was no demon.

1072
01:48:55,356 --> 01:48:57,979
He was a scholar.

1073
01:48:58,117 --> 01:49:00,085
A visionary.

1074
01:49:02,018 --> 01:49:05,055
He built an empire from nothing.

1075
01:49:17,171 --> 01:49:22,797
Why not end this cycle
of violence?

1076
01:49:24,212 --> 01:49:28,665
Or we will be trapped in it
for generations.

1077
01:49:31,219 --> 01:49:34,084
Do you even know
my mother's name?

1078
01:49:38,123 --> 01:49:40,746
Do you know any of their names?

1079
01:49:43,887 --> 01:49:47,753
Anger will not quiet
your soul, my son.

1080
01:49:53,863 --> 01:49:56,003
Don't call me "son."

1081
01:50:02,216 --> 01:50:06,289
These were carved
by a devout follower

1082
01:50:07,462 --> 01:50:09,603
who wore them
to prevent his feet

1083
01:50:09,741 --> 01:50:12,364
from harming any small creature.

1084
01:50:12,502 --> 01:50:16,782
On the side here,
there's an old prayer:

1085
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:20,890
"Forgive me, Mother Earth,
for the sin of injury

1086
01:50:21,028 --> 01:50:24,548
which I inflict with each step."

1087
01:50:27,482 --> 01:50:29,415
My chariot is here.

1088
01:51:19,638 --> 01:51:23,400
You can't.
These people need me.

1089
01:51:23,538 --> 01:51:24,678
Please.

1090
01:51:24,816 --> 01:51:27,059
I'll give you what you want.

1091
01:51:27,197 --> 01:51:29,579
I'll do anything.

1092
01:51:29,717 --> 01:51:31,029
Forgive me.

1093
01:51:31,167 --> 01:51:34,653
Ha-Ha-Have mercy, please.

1094
01:51:34,791 --> 01:51:37,414
Only God can forgive you now.

1095
01:52:20,630 --> 01:52:23,875
Oh God, I worship you.

1096
01:52:24,496 --> 01:52:26,843
I only worship you.

1097
01:52:27,568 --> 01:52:30,295
You are the most powerful one.

1098
01:52:31,814 --> 01:52:34,195
You are my saviour.

1099
01:52:36,094 --> 01:52:37,958
You make us smile.

1100
01:52:38,096 --> 01:52:41,237
And fill our hearts with love.

1101
01:52:41,375 --> 01:52:44,827
All around the world.
In my heart.

1102
01:52:45,655 --> 01:52:49,107
In my home. You are everywhere.

1103
01:52:49,245 --> 01:52:53,939
In every root,
and every drop of water.

1104
01:52:55,285 --> 01:52:59,013
With our eyes. With our ears.

1105
01:52:59,151 --> 01:53:01,775
On our lips. We say your name.

1106
01:53:03,224 --> 01:53:07,884
I sing your praise,
day and night.

1107
01:53:20,034 --> 01:53:22,934
Oh God, I worship you.

1108
01:53:42,712 --> 01:53:46,474
