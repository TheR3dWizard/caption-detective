[rain pattering]

00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:58,435
[rhythmic thudding]

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,734
[thudding intensifies]

00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:16,411
- [thudding stops]
- [sighs]

5
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:19,915
[chairman] Dr. Oppenheimer.

6
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:22,834
Dr. Oppenheimer.

7
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:27,839
As we begin, I believe you have a
statement to read into the record.

8
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:30,926
Yes, Your Honor.

9
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:33,220
[board member] We're
not judges, Doctor.

10
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:34,972
No.

11
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:36,265
[quietly] Of course.

12
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:43,855
Members of the security board.

13
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:48,485
The so-called and derogatory
information in your indictment of me

14
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:50,153
cannot be fairly understood,

15
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:53,699
except in the context
of my life and my work.

16
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:56,243
[Senate aide] How
long did he testify?

17
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:58,787
Honestly, I forget.

18
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:02,165
The whole hearing took a month.

19
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:03,458
An ordeal.

20
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:06,545
I've only read the
transcripts, but... [clears throat]

21
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:10,090
Who'd want to
justify their whole life?

22
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,801
- You weren't there?
- As chairman, I wasn't allowed to be.

23
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:15,012
Are they really
going to ask about it?

24
00:02:15,512 --> 00:02:17,222
It was years ago.

25
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:18,890
- Four years ago. [chuckles]
- Five.

26
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:21,560
Oppenheimer still
divides America.

27
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:23,937
The committee is gonna
want to know where you stood.

28
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:28,317
Senator Thurmond asked me to
say not to feel that you're on trial.

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,403
Aw. Funny, I didn't
till you just said that.

30
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:32,571
Really, Mr. Strauss--

31
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:33,739
It's Admiral.

32
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:36,533
Admiral Strauss.
This is a formality.

33
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,827
President Eisenhower has
asked you to be in his cabinet.

34
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,722
Senate really has no
choice but to confirm you.

35
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:43,081
And if they bring
up Oppenheimer?

36
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:45,500
When they bring up
Oppenheimer, you answer honestly.

37
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:47,794
No senator can deny
you did your duty.

38
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:49,671
It'll be uncomfortable.
[chuckles]

39
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:52,215
Who'd want to
justify their whole life?

40
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:54,301
[loud chattering]

41
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:57,179
[shutter clicks]

42
00:02:57,262 --> 00:03:00,057
[prosecutor] Why did you
leave the United States?

43
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:05,354
I, uh, wanted to
study the new physics.

44
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:06,897
[chairman] Was
there nowhere here?

45
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:10,734
I thought Berkeley had the leading
theoretical physics department.

46
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:13,403
Yes. Once I had built it.

47
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:15,030
But first I had to go to Europe.

48
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:18,450
I went to Cambridge to
study under Patrick Blackett.

49
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,911
Were you happier
there than in America?

50
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:23,121
- Happier?
- Yes.

51
00:03:27,084 --> 00:03:28,752
No.

52
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,003
No, I, uh...

53
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,758
I was homesick, um,

54
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:37,719
emotionally immature,

55
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:44,101
troubled by visions
of a hidden universe.

56
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:50,023
[energy pulsing]

57
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:56,863
Useless in the lab.

[glass shattering]

59
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:04,037
Christ, Oppenheimer.

60
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,164
Have you had any sleep?

61
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:09,292
Start again.

62
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:11,586
I need to go to
the lecture, sir.

63
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:13,213
Why?

64
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:15,090
It's Niels Bohr.

65
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:19,219
I'd completely forgot.

66
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,264
All right. [clears
throat] Let's go.

67
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:27,352
Oh, no, not you, Oppenheimer.
You finish coating those plates.

68
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:28,979
[students chattering, laughing]

69
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:03,930
[cupboard door closes]

70
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:11,813
[Bohr] Quantum physics
is not a step forward.

71
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:15,692
It is a new way to
understand reality.

72
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,569
Einstein's opened the door.

73
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:21,907
Now we are peering through,
seeing a world inside our world.

74
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,245
A world of energy and paradox
that not everyone can accept.

75
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:37,297
[energy pulsing]

76
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,402

[students chattering]

78
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:12,123
- Yeah-- Are you all right?
- [breathing heavily]

79
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:15,335
Niels, meet J.
Robert Oppenheimer.

80
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,504
What's the J stand for?

81
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:18,922
Nothing, apparently.

82
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,508
You were at my lecture. You
asked the only good question.

83
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,191
[Blackett] No one's
denying his insight.

84
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,620
It's his laboratory work that
leaves a little to be desired.

85
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:27,949
I heard you give
the same lectu--

86
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:30,475
At Harvard, yes, and you
asked the same question.

87
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,643
Why ask again?

88
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:32,978
Hadn't liked your answer.

89
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:36,231
Did you like it
better yesterday?

90
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,357
A lot.

91
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,945
You can lift the stone without being
ready for the snake that's revealed.

92
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:44,155
Now it seems you're ready.

93
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:45,699
But you don't enjoy the lab?

94
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,494
So get out of Cambridge
with its beakers and potions.

95
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:52,205
Go somewhere
they'll let you think.

96
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:54,291
[whispers] Where?

97
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,751
Göttingen.

98
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:58,712
- Born.
- Born.

99
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:00,505
Get to Germany.
Study under Max Born.

100
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:03,133
Learn the ways of theory.

101
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:04,259
I'll send word.

102
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,137
- Wormhole.
- [apple clatters]

103
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:09,931
How's your mathematics?

104
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,017
Not good enough for the
physicist he wants to be.

105
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,352
Algebra's like sheet music.

106
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:16,605
The important thing isn't
"can you read music?"

107
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:18,189
It's "can you hear it?"

108
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:20,609
Can you hear the music, Robert?

109
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,861
Yes, I can.

110
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:50,055
[no audible dialogue]

111
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:42,315

[rhythmic thudding]

113
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:00,792
The senator from Wyoming.

114
00:09:01,835 --> 00:09:02,919
Admiral Strauss,

115
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:06,423
I'm interested in your relationship
with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

116
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:08,216
You met him in 1947?

117
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:09,759
Correct.

118
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,054
You were commissioner of
the Atomic Energy Commission?

119
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:18,268
I was, but I actually met Robert
in my capacity as board member

120
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:20,729
of the Institute for
Advanced Study at Princeton,

121
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:23,773
because after the war
he was world renowned

122
00:09:23,857 --> 00:09:25,066
as the great man of physics,

123
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,320
and I was determined to
get him to run the Institute.

124
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:41,791
Dr. Oppenheimer. An honor.

125
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,959
Mr. Strauss.

126
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,253
It's pronounced "straws."

127
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,796
Oh-ppenheimer, Oppenheimer.

128
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,680
Whatever way you say
it, they know I'm Jewish.

129
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:49,883
[chuckles]

130
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:52,886
I'm president of Temple
Emanu-El in Manhattan.

131
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:55,555
"Straws" is just the
Southern pronunciation.

132
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,724
Anyway, welcome
to the Institute.

133
00:09:57,807 --> 00:09:59,392
I think you could
be very happy here.

134
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:01,519
Yes, well, you'll
love the commute.

135
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:04,147
The position comes with that
house for you and your wife,

136
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,107
and your-- Is it two children?

137
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:07,192
Yes, two.

138
00:10:07,776 --> 00:10:10,153
I'm a great admirer
of your work.

139
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:12,530
And you're a physicist
by training, Mr. Strauss?

140
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:14,699
I'm sorry, common
room, four o'clock tea.

141
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:17,494
No, I'm not trained in
physics or anything else.

142
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:18,620
I'm a self-made man.

143
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:21,206
- Ah. I can relate to that.
- Really?

144
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:23,082
Yes, my father was one.

145
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,961
And this would be your office.

146
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,927
[birds chirping]

147
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:38,348
I'm told he's there
most afternoons.

148
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,558
You know, I've always wondered

149
00:10:40,642 --> 00:10:43,603
why you didn't involve him
in the Manhattan Project.

150
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:48,107
Greatest scientific
mind of our time.

151
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,317
Of his time.

152
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:52,278
Einstein published
his Theory of Relativity

153
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:54,989
more than 40 years ago now.

154
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:58,660
But never embraced the
quantum world it revealed.

155
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:00,161
"God doesn't play dice."

156
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:02,288
Precisely.

157
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:05,083
You never thought of studying
physics formally, Mr. Strauss?

158
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,794
I had offers, but I
chose to sell shoes.

159
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:10,713
Lewis Strauss was once
a lowly shoe salesman.

160
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,842
No, just a shoe salesman.

161
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:15,176
[chuckles]

162
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,222
I'd love to introduce you.

163
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,431
No need.

164
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,725
I have known him for years.

165
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:45,581
Albert.

166
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,211
What was that?

167
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,173
What did you say to him?

168
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:57,677
Oh, he's fine.

169
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,309
Mr. Strauss, there are things in
my past you ought to be aware of.

170
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:07,687
Well, as chairman of the AEC, I
have access to your security file.

171
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,771
I've read it.

172
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:10,398
- You're not worried?
- No.

173
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,793
Why would I be worried after
everything you've done for your country?

174
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,777
Well, times change, Mr. Strauss.

175
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:16,821
Well, the purpose
of this institute

176
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:19,198
is to provide a haven
for independent minds.

177
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:21,409
That's you.

178
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:23,286
You are the man for the job.

179
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,872
Well, then I'll consider it.

180
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,041
I'll see you at the
AEC meeting tomorrow.

181
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:32,754
[scoffs]

182
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:35,423
This is one of the most prestigious
appointments in the country.

183
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,634
Yes, with a great commute.

184
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,761
That's why I'm considering it.

185
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,974
[McGee] So, Dr. Oppenheimer brought
your attention to his past associstions

186
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:46,476
before you appointed him?

187
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,270
- Yes.
- And they didn't concern you?

188
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:52,941
Just then I was entirely consumed
with what he must have said to Einstein

189
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:55,693
- to sour him on me.
- [gallery laughing]

190
00:12:58,196 --> 00:12:59,197
But later?

191
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,741
Well, we all know
what happened later.

192
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,785
[prosecutor] Doctor,
your time in Europe,

193
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:06,913
you seemed to meet with a wide
range of other countries' physicists.

194
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:07,997
Yes, that's right.

195
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:09,374
Any Russians?

196
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,377
None that spring to mind.

197
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,963
If you'll just allow me to
continue with my statement--

198
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:18,466
Mr. Robb, you'll have ample
opportunity to cross-examine.

199
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,389
After Göttingen, I moved
on to Leiden in Holland,

200
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:26,391
where I first met Isidor Rabi.

201
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:28,559
[Rabi clears throat] Excuse me.

202
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:35,692
A Yank, lecturing
on the new physics?

203
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:36,776
This I have to hear.

204
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,945
I'm an American myself.

205
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:40,154
How surprising.

206
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:43,741
Let me know if you need
any help with the English.

207
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:47,870
[students laughing]

208
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:53,209
[speaking Dutch]

209
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,173
Wait, what's he saying?

210
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,561
No, thank you.

211
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:13,479
It's a long way to Zurich.

212
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:16,283
You get any skinnier, we're gonna
lose you between the seat cushions.

213
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:17,984
I'm Rabi.

214
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,360
Oppenheimer.

215
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:21,404
I caught your
lecture on molecules.

216
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:22,697
Caught some of it.

217
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,908
We're a couple of New York
Jews. How do you know Dutch?

218
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:28,870
Well, I thought I'd better learn
it when I got here this semester.

219
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:32,165
You learned enough Dutch in six weeks
to give a lecture on quantum mechanics?

220
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:33,708
Wanted to challenge myself.

221
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,085
Quantum physics wasn't
challenging enough.

222
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:37,754
- Schvitzer.
- Schvitzer?

223
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:39,338
- Show-off.
- [chuckles]

224
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:41,632
Dutch in six weeks, but
you never learned Yiddish?

225
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:43,676
They don't speak it so
much my side of the park.

226
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,178
Screw you.

227
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:48,765
- You homesick?
- Oh, you know it.

228
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:52,769
Ever get the feeling our kind
isn't entirely welcome here?

229
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:53,853
Physicists?

230
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,396
That's funny.

231
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,023
Not in the department.

232
00:14:57,607 --> 00:14:58,775
They're all Jewish too.

233
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:01,986
Eat.

234
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,824
There's a German
you have to seek out.

235
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:09,452
- Heisenberg.
- Right.

236
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,248
[Heisenberg speaking German]

237
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:23,591
One might be led to the presumption
that behind the quantum world,

238
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:27,470
there still hides a real world
in which causality holds,

239
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:31,891
but such speculations seem to
us, to say it explicitly, fruitless.

240
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,851
Thank you. Have a great day.

241
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,399
- Werner. Wonderful.
- Thank you.

242
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:42,235
Dr. Oppenheimer.

243
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:46,030
Oppenheimer, yes. I liked
your paper on molecules.

244
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:47,532
Probably because
you inspired it.

245
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:50,255
If I inspire anything else, let me
know. We could publish together.

246
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:51,953
I have to get back to America.

247
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:53,079
Why?

248
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:55,957
There's no one there taking
quantum mechanics seriously.

249
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,625
That's exactly why.

250
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,128
He's pining for the
canyons of Manhattan.

251
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:02,505
Canyons of New Mexico.

252
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:03,631
You're from New Mexico?

253
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:07,218
No. New York, but my brother
and I have a ranch outside Santa Fe.

254
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:09,804
That's the America
I miss right now.

255
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:13,141
- Then it's best you get home, cowboys.
- [Oppenheimer, Rabi chuckle]

256
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:14,225
That's him.

257
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,186
No, me and horses?
I don't think so.

258
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,605
Nice to meet you.

259
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:23,734
Did you ever encounter
Heisenberg again?

260
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:25,862
Not in person, no, but, uh...

261
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:29,991
you might say our paths crossed.

262
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,952
On returning to America,

263
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:35,955
I accepted positions at both
Caltech and up at Berkeley.

264
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,957
[people chattering]

265
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,340
[equipment clattering]

266
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:55,474
[sighs]

267
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,231
Dr. Lawrence, I presume?

268
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,402
- You must be Oppenheimer.
- Yes.

269
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:09,155
I hear you want to start a
school of quantum theory.

270
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,990
I am starting it. Next door.

271
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,241
They put you in there?

272
00:17:12,325 --> 00:17:15,578
I asked for it. Wanted to be
close to you experimentalists.

273
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,330
Theory will get you
only so far, huh?

274
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:19,333
We're building a machine
to accelerate electrons.

275
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:20,416
Magnificent.

276
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:21,918
Would you like to help?

277
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:23,836
Build it? Oh, no. [chuckles]

278
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,921
No, no.

279
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:27,673
But I am working on
theories I'd like to test with it.

280
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:29,050
When do you start teaching?

281
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,426
I've got my first in an hour.

282
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,470
- Seminar?
- Pupil.

283
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:35,348
One student? That's it?

284
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,559
I'm teaching something
no one here has dreamt of.

285
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:40,621
But once people start hearing
what you can do with it--

286
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:42,104
There's no going back.

287
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:43,564
[door opens]

288
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,109
- Oh. I must have missed the--
- Mr. Lomanitz?

289
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:48,194
Nah--

290
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:50,655
Yeah.

291
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:51,739
Yes, this is it.

292
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,658
Please. Take a seat.

293
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:55,910
[clears throat]

294
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:00,581
What do you know about
quantum mechanics?

295
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,584
I have a grasp on the basics.

296
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:05,044
Then you're doing it wrong.

297
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:08,172
Is light made up of
particles or waves?

298
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:10,841
Quantum mechanics says
it's both. How could it be both?

299
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:12,385
- It can't.
- It can't.

300
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:14,095
But it is.

301
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:17,515
It's paradoxical,
and yet, it works.

302
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:25,856
Now...

303
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:29,735
Thank you.

304
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:31,487
Mr. Lomanitz.

305
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,571
You're gonna be okay.

306
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:34,198
Mr. Snyder.

307
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:36,325
Now let's consider a star.

308
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:37,952
A star.

309
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,954
A vast furnace
burning in outer space,

310
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:42,581
fire pushing outwards
against its own gravity.

311
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:43,833
Balanced.

312
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:46,502
But if that furnace cools

313
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:50,589
and gravity starts
winning, it contracts.

314
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:51,757
Density increases.

315
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,468
Correct. Increasing gravity.

316
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:56,304
- Increasing density.
- And?

317
00:18:56,387 --> 00:18:59,432
It's a vicious cycle until...
What's the limit here?

318
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:03,227
[chuckles] I don't know.
See where the math takes us.

319
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:04,871
I guarantee it's somewhere
no one's been before.

320
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,397
Me?

321
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,941
Yes, you. Your math
is better than mine.

322

[Bartlett]
Dr. Oppenheimer's file

324
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:15,406
contained details of
his activities in Berkeley.

00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:19,160
Why would they have started a file
on Dr. Oppenheimer before the war?

326
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,288
Well, you'd have
to ask Mr. Hoover.

327
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:24,165
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

328
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,959
Uh, my assumption is

329
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:32,715
that it was connected to his,
uh, left-wing political activities.

330
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,425
[door opens]

331
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,762
You shouldn't let them bring up
politics in the classroom, Oppie.

332
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:38,846
I wrote that.

333
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,058
Lawrence, you embrace
the revolution in physics.

334
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:44,101
Can't you see it
everywhere else?

335
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:46,270
Picasso, Stravinsky,
Freud, Marx.

336
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:49,065
Well, this is America,
Oppie. We had our revolution.

337
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:53,110
Seriously, keep
it out of the lab.

338
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:57,656
Well, out of the lab, my landlady is
having a discussion group tonight.

339
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,741
Interested?

340
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:00,910
I have sampled the
Berkeley political scene.

341
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:05,373
It's all just philosophy postgrads
and communists talking integration.

342
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:07,041
You don't care
about integration?

343
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:08,876
I want to vote for
it, not talk about it.

344
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,211
Especially on a Friday.

345
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,337
Come on. Let's eat.

346
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,922
I'm meeting my brother there.

347
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:17,385
[Bartlett] And how would these activities
have come to the attention of the FBI?

348
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:19,470
Well, if I remember correctly,

349
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:23,641
the FBI was taking license plates
outside suspected communist gatherings,

350
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,393
and his name popped up.

351
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,403
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry.

352
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:37,071
- Frank.
- Robert.

353
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,698
Uh, you remember Jackie.

354
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:40,783
Evening.

355
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:42,701
Let's go.

356
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:45,871
[people chattering]

357
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,124
[student] Robert.

358
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:50,501
I want you to meet Chevalier.

359
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:53,629
Dr. Haakon Chevalier,
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

360
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:54,713
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

361
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:56,757
- This is my little brother, Frank.
- Hello.

362
00:20:56,841 --> 00:20:58,384
- And this is--
- Still Jackie.

363
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,510
Hello, Still Jackie.

364
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,554
Chevalier, you're in languages?

365
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,305
And your reputation
precedes you.

366
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:04,390
What have you heard?

367
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,684
That you're teaching a
radical new approach to physics

368
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:10,062
I have no chance of understanding,
but I hadn't heard you're a Party member.

369
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:11,689
- I'm not.
- Not yet.

370
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:14,209
Frank and I are thinking of
joining. Just the other day, I was--

371
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,568
I support a range of causes.

372
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:16,735
The Spanish Civil War?

373
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:20,156
A democratic republic being
overthrown by fascist thugs, who wouldn't?

374
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:23,993
Our government. They think that
socialism is a bigger threat than fascism.

375
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:26,787
Not for long. Look at what
the Nazis are doing to the Jews.

376
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:29,415
I send funds to colleagues
in Germany to emigrate.

377
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,125
I have to do something.

378
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,879
My own work is so abstract.

379
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:38,466
- What are you working on?
- What happens to stars when they die.

380
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:39,592
Do stars die?

381
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:44,430
Well, if they do, they
cool, then collapse.

382
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:49,143
In fact, the bigger the star,
the more violent its demise.

383
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:53,105
Their gravity gets so
concentrated, it swallows everything.

384
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,274
Everything, even light.

385
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,609
Can that really happen?

386
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,319
The math says it can.

387
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:01,489
If we can get published, then perhaps
one day an astronomer finds one.

388
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:05,367
But right now, all I have is theory,
which can't impact people's lives.

389
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:07,495
Well, if you're going to
send money to Spain,

390
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:08,996
do it through the
Communist Party.

391
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,040
They can get it
to the front lines.

392
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:12,416
Mary sent me with these.

393
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,376
I'm Jean.

394
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:16,295
Robert.

395
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,421
Haakon Chevalier.

396
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:19,423
The union meeting
at Serber's last month.

397
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:20,799
Right, right, yes.

398
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,218
Oh, thank you.

399
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,613
[Chevalier] Robert here
says he's not a communist.

400
00:22:24,637 --> 00:22:26,764
Well, then he doesn't
know enough about it.

401
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,517
I've read Das Kapital,
all three volumes.

402
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,601
Does that count?

403
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,895
It would make you better
read than most party members.

404
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:36,524
It's turgid stuff. There's some
thinking, "Ownership is theft."

405
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:37,650
"Property."

406
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,068
"Property"?

407
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,402
"Property," not "ownership."

408
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:42,279
I'm sorry, I read it in
the original German.

409
00:22:42,363 --> 00:22:43,739
[chuckles]

410
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,366
- [Chevalier] Well...
- [glasses clink]

411
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,117
It's not about the book.

412
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,827
It's about the ideas.

413
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:50,454
And you sound uncommitted.

414
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:53,832
I'm committed to thinking freely
about how to improve our world.

415
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:56,627
Why limit yourself to one dogma?

416
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,588
You're a physicist. You
pick and choose rules?

417
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:03,801
Or do you use the discipline to
channel your energies into progress?

418
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,761
I like a little wiggle room.

419
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:08,764
Do you always
toe the party line?

420
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,184
I like my wiggle room too.

421
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:17,356
[panting]

422
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:23,946
- What?
- [laughs]

423
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:25,823
Wait, wait, wait.

424
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,580
- Unexpected.
- What?

425
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:34,081
For a physicist.

426
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,625
You only have a
shelf full of Freud?

427
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:39,128
Well, actually, my
background's more--

428
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,379
Jungian?

429
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:43,757
You know analysis?

430
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:47,136
When I was a postgrad at
Cambridge, I had a little trouble.

431
00:23:48,304 --> 00:23:49,305
I'll bite.

432
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:50,931
I tried to poison my tutor.

433
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:52,016
Did you hate him?

434
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,517
I liked him very much.

435
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:55,394
You just needed to get laid.

436
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,937
Took my analyst two years,

437
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:59,148
and I don't think they
ever put it that succinctly.

438
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:03,068
You have everyone convinced you're
more complicated than you actually are.

439
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:04,987
We're all simple souls, I guess.

440
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,280
I'm not.

441
00:24:09,158 --> 00:24:10,159
What's this?

442
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:11,827
Sanskrit.

443
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,078
You can read this?

444
00:24:13,162 --> 00:24:14,747
I'm learning.

445
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:20,753
Read this.

446
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:26,258
Well, in this part, Vishnu
reveals his multi-armed self--

447
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:27,426
No.

448
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:30,179
Read the words.

449
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:36,060
"And now I am become Death."

450
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,191
[thunder rumbling]

451
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:43,817
"The destroyer of worlds."

452
00:24:46,487 --> 00:24:48,113
[wind whistling]

453
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,641
[Oppenheimer] This'll do.

454
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,520
[wind howling]

455
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:23,607
It'll break before dawn.

456
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:27,486
Air cools overnight. Just
before dawn, it breaks.

457
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:31,073
Come on. Come on.

458
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,038
- [chuckles]
- [Lawrence sighs]

459
00:25:38,122 --> 00:25:40,165
[grunts] So...

460
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,625
I'm getting married.

461
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,919
- Frank. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

462
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,003
To Jackie?

463
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:47,548
- Yeah, to Jackie.
- [Oppenheimer clears throat]

464
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:48,716
The waitress.

465
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,634
Oppie, you're
right. It's lettin' up.

466
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:52,553
I'm gonna go see
if there's any stars.

467
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:56,890
All your talk about the common man, but
Jackie's not good enough for you, hmm?

468
00:25:57,808 --> 00:26:00,185
We join the Party, and you
can't hide your disapproval, why?

469
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:02,229
Is that because that's
supposed to be your thing?

470
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:03,672
I haven't joined
the Party, Frank.

471
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:06,400
And I don't think she should
have convinced you to either.

472
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,026
Half of the faculty
is communist.

473
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,111
Not that half.

474
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:13,323
I'm your brother, Frank,
and I want you to be cautious.

475
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,607
And I want to wring your neck.

476
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:20,164
I won't live my life
afraid to make a mistake.

477
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:25,419
You're happy, I'm happy.

478
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,255
So then I'm happy you're
happy that I'm happy.

479
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:36,597
I feel like I could see one of those
dark stars that you're working on.

480
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,558
You can't. That's
the whole point.

481
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,727
Their gravity swallows light.

482
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,855
It's like a kind
of hole in space.

483
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:47,065
Is Frank okay?

484
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:49,818
Yes. He just has
a shitty brother.

485
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:52,154
It is special here.

486
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:55,991
When I was a kid,

487
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:58,827
I thought if I could find a way

488
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:04,583
to combine physics
and New Mexico,

489
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,335
my life would be perfect.

490
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:07,544
[chuckles]

491
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,339
- Little remote for that.
- Yes.

492
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,174
Let's get some sleep.

493
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:17,179
That mesa we saw today, one
of my favorite places in the world.

494
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:19,223
Tomorrow we'll climb it.

495
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:21,099
[Lawrence] What's it called?

496
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,352
[Oppenheimer] Los Alamos.

497
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,233
I didn't expect
to see you today.

498
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,361
Do I have to make
an appointment?

499
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,238
[store bell jingles]

500
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:36,907
- Hey! Hey, get back here!
- Alvarez?

501
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:45,457
[Alvarez] Oppie! Oppie!

502
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,709
[Oppenheimer] What? What is it?

503
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,920
They've done it.
They've done it.

504
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:52,923
Hahn and Strassmann in Germany.
They split the uranium nucleus.

505
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:55,634
[Lawrence] How?

506
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:58,720
Bombarded it with neutrons.

507
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:01,473
It's a nuclear fission. They
did it, they split the atom.

508
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:02,766
It's not possible.

509
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,899
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.

510
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,616
See? Can't be done.

511
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,077
[Lawrence] Very elegant.

512
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:24,121
Quite clear.

513
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,290
- There's just one problem.
- Where?

514
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:28,041
Next door.

515
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:29,710
Alvarez did it.

516
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:31,920
But then look,

517
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:35,507
these fission pulses,
they're massive.

518
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:39,595
I've seen 30 of these
in the past ten minutes.

519
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:42,180
Theory will take
you only so far.

520
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:45,309
During the process,

521
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:50,898
extra neutrons boil off, which could
be used to split other uranium atoms.

522
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:54,067
Chain reaction. You're
thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

523
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:57,946
You, me, and every other physicist
around the world who's seen the news.

524
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:00,782
What? What are we all thinking?

525
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:04,453
A bomb, Alvarez.

526
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:06,914
A bomb.

527
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:10,417
I told you, Robert, no
more fucking flowers.

528
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:15,464
- I don't understand what you want from me.
- I don't want anything from you.

529
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:20,636
- Well, you say that and then you call.
- Well, don't answer.

530
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:23,013
I'll always answer.

531
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:31,438
Fine. Just no more flowers.

532
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:34,566
You're not coming?

533
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:38,685
[Chevalier] You have to know
when you're beaten, Robert.

534
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:42,449
It's not that simple, Hoke.

535
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:45,011
- Chevalier, good to see you.
- [students] F-A-E-C-T! F-A-E-C-T!

536
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:48,288
Barbara, good to see you, and
the illustrious Dr. Oppenheimer.

537
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:50,457
- I'm Eltenton.
- Pleasure.

538
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,625
Please, please.

539
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:55,462
Might you say a word about
organized labor on campuses, yes?

540
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:56,964
Coming through! Coming through.

541
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:58,340
I work at Shell.

542
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,717
We've signed up chemists,
we signed up engineers,

543
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:02,469
so why not scientists
in academia?

544
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:07,599
[students chanting] Oppie!
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

545
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:09,434
[cheering, applauding]

546
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:18,276
Teachers are unionized.

547
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:21,405
- Why not professors?
- Don't you have somewhere to be?

548
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,282
Lawrence, academics
have rights too.

549
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:26,243
Look, it's not that. I've
got a group coming.

550
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,161
Oh. I'll sit in.

551
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:29,287
Not this one.

552
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,791
[door opens]

553
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:38,880
Richard. Dr. Bush. What
brings you two up north?

554
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,560
Richard, you tell Ruth I'll be
down to Pasadena Thursday.

555
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:58,775
[sighs]

556
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,780
Your paper on black holes is in!

557
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:07,284
Where's Hartland?

558
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,453
Get Hartland. Get Hartland.

559
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:13,165
September 1st, 1939. The
world's gonna remember this day.

560
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:14,583
[chuckles]

561
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,668
Oh, Hartland. Our
paper, it's in print.

562
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:18,628
We've been upstaged.

563
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,675
[Oppenheimer] During
the Battle of Britain,

564
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,678
I found myself
increasingly out of sympathy

565
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:30,891
with the policy of neutrality
that communists advocated.

566
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:34,061
But after Hitler invaded
Russia and we became allies,

567
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,480
these communist
sympathies, did they return?

568
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:37,563
No.

569
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:42,527
I need to make clear that
my changing views on Russia

570
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:45,989
did not mean a sharp break from
those who held different views.

571
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:48,366
For a year or two, and
during a previous marriage,

572
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,661
my wife Kitty had been a
Communist Party member.

573
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:54,414
[guests chattering, laughing]

574
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:57,834
This way. This is where
I keep the good stuff.

575
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,711
I thought this was
the Tolmans' house.

576
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:01,713
I live with them
while I'm at Caltech.

577
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:04,716
- Do you two need anything?
- [Oppenheimer] We're good, Ruthie.

578
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,678
So, you're a biologist.

579
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:12,516
Well, somehow I have
graduated to housewife.

580
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,144
Can you explain quantum
mechanics to me? Seems baffling.

581
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:17,729
Yes, it is.

582
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:22,567
Well, this glass, this drink,

583
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:27,364
this countertop, uh, our bodies,

584
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:30,075
all of it.

585
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,411
It's mostly empty space.

586
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:36,540
Groupings of tiny energy
waves bound together.

587
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:37,624
By what?

588
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:41,461
Forces of attraction strong
enough to convince us

589
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:45,966
that matter is solid, stop my
body passing through yours.

590
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,640
[chattering]

591
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:00,272
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

592
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:01,856
Not very.

593
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:07,737
There is someone that I feel--

594
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:09,156
Does she feel the same way?

595
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,615
Sometimes.

596
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:12,909
Not enough.

597
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:17,080
You know, I'm
going to New Mexico.

598
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:20,000
To my ranch, with
friends. You should come.

599
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,253
I meant with your husband.

600
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:24,379
Yes, you did.

601
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:26,882
'Cause you know it won't
make a bit of difference.

602
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:33,054
[Oppenheimer] Why
did you marry him?

603
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:36,308
I was lost and he was kind.

604
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:39,644
Lost?

605
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:42,063
Well, my previous
husband had died

606
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:45,317
and at 28 I wasn't really
ready to be a widow.

607
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,818
Who was your first husband?

608
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:50,113
Nobody. But my second
husband was Joe Dallet.

609
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:52,616
He was, um, from money, like me,

610
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:56,203
but he was a union organizer
in Youngstown, Ohio.

611
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:57,412
Fell hard.

612
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:58,872
[chuckles] How hard?

613
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:01,684
Hard enough to spend the next four
years living off beans and pancakes,

614
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,669
handing out the Daily
Worker at factory gates.

615
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:07,547
By 36, I just told Joe I
couldn't take it anymore.

616
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:10,133
Quit the Party. A year
later, I wanted him back.

617
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:12,802
Him, not the Daily Worker.

618
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,971
He said, "Swell, I'll meet
you on my way to Spain."

619
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:16,455
He went to fight
for the Loyalists?

620
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:19,559
And then he went to the
brigades and I waited, and...

621
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:24,648
Joe got himself killed first time he
popped his head outta the trench.

622
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,817
Ideology got Joe
killed. For nothing.

623
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,694
Spanish Republic isn't nothing.

624
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:32,781
My husband offered both our
futures to stop one fascist bullet

625
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:35,033
from embedding
itself in a mudbank.

626
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,328
That's the
definition of nothing.

627
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,288
- Seems a little reductive.
- Pragmatic.

628
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:43,625
Now here I am.

629
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:47,837
Wherever the hell this is.

630
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,555
I didn't want you to
hear it from anyone else.

631
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,477
Least you didn't
bring me flowers.

632
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,728
[sniffles]

633
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,273
[chuckles]

634
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:12,320
We both know I'm not
what you want, Jean.

635
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:15,532
Yeah, but it's a door closing.

636
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,450
No.

637
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,371
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

638
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,333
You knocked her up. Fast work.

639
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:28,086
- Can't keep a good man down.
- [chuckles]

640
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:29,379
I meant her.

641
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:33,383
She knew what she wanted.
What about the husband?

642
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:34,884
We talked.

643
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:36,219
They're getting a divorce

644
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:40,473
so we can get married
before she starts showing.

645
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:42,058
How civilized.

646
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,604
You idiot. This is
your community.

647
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:50,275
You think the rules don't
apply to the golden boy?

648
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,736
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

649
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:57,073
Don't alienate the only people in
the world that understand what you do.

650
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,327
One day you might need them.

651
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,954
[students chanting]
F-A-E-C-T! F-A-E-C-T!

652
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:05,099
[Oppenheimer] The Federation
of Architects, Engineers,

653
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:07,250
Chemists and Technicians.

654
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:17,510
- Lomanitz, what do you get paid a month?
- That's not the point, Lawrence.

655
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:22,432
What do any of you have in common
with farm laborers and dock workers?

656
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:23,725
[Lomanitz] Plenty.

657
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:26,936
Everybody out. Now!

658
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:32,859
Not you.

659
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:34,736
[footsteps departing]

660
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:37,822
[door closes]

661
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:39,699
What are you doing?

662
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:43,411
- It's a trade union.
- Filled with communists.

663
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:45,330
So? I haven't joined the Party.

664
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:48,917
They won't let me bring you onto
the project because of this shit.

665
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,294
They won't even let me
tell you what the project is.

666
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:54,255
- Oh, I know what the project is.
- Oh, really?

667
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:56,966
We've all heard about Einstein
and Szilard's letter to Roosevelt

668
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,730
warning him the Germans
could make a bomb,

669
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,055
and I know what it means
for the Nazis to have a bomb.

670
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:03,515
And I don't?

671
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:06,643
It's not your people
they're herding into camps.

672
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:07,852
It's mine.

673
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:10,939
You think that I tell
them about your politics.

674
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:14,794
The next time you're
coming home from a meeting,

675
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,820
why don't you take a
look in the rearview mirror?

676
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:21,783
Listen to the sounds on your phone
line and stop being so goddamn naive.

677
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:24,577
Why would they care what I do?

678
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:28,832
Because you're not just
self-important, you're actually important.

679
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:33,294
Okay.

680
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:37,465
- I get it.
- If you could just be a little more--

681
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:38,716
Pragmatic.

682
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,760
I'll talk to Lomanitz,
I'll talk to the others.

683
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,430
You don't have to worry.
It's done, Lawrence.

684
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:50,186
Then welcome to the war.

685
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:53,231
I filled out my first
security questionnaire

686
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:56,526
and was informed that my
involvement with left-wing groups

687
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:00,530
would not prove a bar to my
working on the atomic program.

688
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:03,199
[Pastore] Why were his
communist associations

689
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:06,119
not seen as a security
risk during the war?

690
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:09,289
Senator, I can't possibly
answer for security clearance

691
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:11,374
granted years before
I ever met the man.

692
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,418
Fine. What about after?

693
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,502
After the war,

694
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:19,215
Dr. Oppenheimer was the most
respected scientific voice in the world.

695
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:21,342
That's why I asked
him to run the Institute.

696
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:24,304
That's why he advised the
Atomic Energy Commission.

697
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:25,513
Simple as that.

698
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:27,640
What are they accusing me of?

699
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:31,769
I think they just wanna know what
happened between 1947 and 1954

700
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:34,564
to change your mind on
Oppenheimer's security clearance.

701
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:35,648
I didn't.

702
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,442
I was chair of the AEC,

703
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:40,904
but it wasn't me that brought
the charges against Robert.

704
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:42,280
Who did?

705
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:44,300
Some former staff member of
the Joint Congressional Committee.

706
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:47,368
He was a rabid
anti-communist named Borden.

707
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,662
He wrote to the FBI
demanding they take action.

708
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:52,248
The FBI? Why not
go to the AEC direct?

709
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:54,834
Why get caught holding
the knife yourself?

710
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,711
What did Borden have
against Oppenheimer?

711
00:38:56,794 --> 00:38:58,463
This was the McCarthy Era.

712
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,675
People hounded out of
jobs for any hint of red.

713
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:05,762
And then, reading
Oppenheimer's security file,

714
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:08,848
his communist brother,
sister-in-law, fiancée,

715
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,266
best friend, wife.

716
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,769
That's before we even get
to the Chevalier incident.

717
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:16,189
But how would Borden have
access to Oppenheimer's security file?

718
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:18,191
Because somebody gave it to him.

719
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:21,736
Somebody who
wanted Robert silenced.

720
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:23,821
- Who?
- [Strauss] Who knows?

721
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:27,825
Robert didn't take care not to upset
the power brokers in Washington.

722
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:31,287
His opinions on the
atom became definitive

723
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:33,873
and he wasn't always
patient with us mere mortals.

724
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,837
I came in for plenty
of harsh treatment.

725
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:43,299
There was an AEC vote

726
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:45,802
on the export of
isotopes to Norway,

727
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:48,555
and they drafted in Robert
to make me look like a fool.

728
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:51,617
[congressman] But, Dr. Oppenheimer,
we've already heard from Admiral Strauss

729
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:54,894
that these isotopes could
be useful to our enemies

730
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,418
in the production
of atomic weapons.

731
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:59,649
Congressmen, you could use a
shovel in making atomic weapons.

732
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:00,733
In fact, you do.

733
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:03,861
You could use a bottle of
beer in making atomic weapons.

734
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:05,321
In fact, you do.

735
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:08,741
I say isotopes are less useful
than electronic components,

736
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:11,995
- but more useful than a sandwich.
- [gallery laughs]

737
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:16,302
[Strauss] Genius is no
guarantee of wisdom.

738
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,794
How could this man who
saw so much be so blind?

739
00:40:20,962 --> 00:40:23,339
- [crickets chirping]
- [baby crying]

740
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:30,597
Kitty?

741
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,434
[baby continues crying]

742
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:36,769
Kitty?

743
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:40,607
Kitty, the project--

744
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:44,652
I'm in. I'm in.

745
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:46,029
Let's celebrate.

746
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:53,536
Shouldn't you go to him?

747
00:40:58,374 --> 00:41:01,544
I have been going
to him all fucking day.

748
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,926
[baby continues crying]

749
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:14,932
[engine turns off]

750
00:41:15,016 --> 00:41:16,309
Okay.

751
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:19,479
- [baby continues crying]
- [knocks on door]

752
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:24,734
Here.

753
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,444
Come here, darling.

754
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,863
I don't know how to say this.

755
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:31,574
I-I'm ashamed to ask.

756
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:33,159
[Chevalier] Anything.

757
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:36,037
- Take Peter.
- Sure.

758
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,955
No, for a while, Hoke.

759
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:39,916
A while.

760
00:41:41,876 --> 00:41:44,087
Does Kitty know you're here?

761
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,380
Yes, of course she knows.

762
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:47,674
Of course she knows.

763
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:51,094
We're awful people.
Selfish, awful people.

764
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:54,389
Forget I asked.

765
00:41:54,472 --> 00:41:56,391
Selfish, awful people,

766
00:41:56,474 --> 00:41:58,810
they don't know
they're selfish and awful.

767
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:01,104
Sit, sit, sit.

768
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:06,484
Robert, you see beyond
the world we live in.

769
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:10,238
There is a price
to be paid for that.

770
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:12,281
Of course we'll help you.

771
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:25,253
[Kitty] Everything's
changing, Robert.

772
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:27,517
Having a child was
always going to change--

773
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:31,092
No, the world, it's pivoting
in some new direction.

774
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:33,302
It's reforming.

775
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:37,014
This is your moment.

776
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:40,327
We're putting together a
group to study feasibili--

777
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:43,104
"We" shouldn't be doing
anything. You should.

778
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:45,606
Lawrence won't get this done.

779
00:42:46,274 --> 00:42:48,484
Or Tolman, or Rabi. You will.

780
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:53,656
[chattering]

781
00:42:57,702 --> 00:42:59,328
[Oppenheimer] Who
are the uniforms?

782
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:01,581
I thought you might know.

783
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,792
- [door opens]
- [colonel] Dr. Oppenheimer.

784
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:07,503
I'm Colonel Groves.

785
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:09,714
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Nichols.

786
00:43:09,797 --> 00:43:11,048
Have that dry cleaned.

787
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:19,140
Well, if that's how you
treat Lieutenant Colonel,

788
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:22,769
I'd hate to see how you
treat a humble physicist.

789
00:43:22,852 --> 00:43:24,645
If I ever meet one,
I'll let you know.

790
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:26,147
[chuckles] Ouch.

791
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,776
Theaters of combat all over the
world but I have to stay in Washington.

792
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:32,612
- Why?
- I built the Pentagon.

793
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:37,116
The brass likes it so much they made me
take over the Manhattan Engineer District.

794
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,700
Which is?

795
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:40,745
Don't be a smart ass.

796
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:42,028
You know damn well what it is.

797
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,540
You and half of every physics
department across the country.

798
00:43:44,624 --> 00:43:46,501
That's problem number one.

799
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:49,629
I thought problem number one
would be securing enough uranium ore.

800
00:43:49,712 --> 00:43:53,257
- 1, 200 tons bought the day I took charge.
- Processing?

801
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:55,676
Just broke ground at
Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

802
00:43:56,844 --> 00:43:58,471
Now I'm looking
for a project director.

803
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:00,640
And my name came up?

804
00:44:00,723 --> 00:44:01,808
Nope.

805
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:05,186
Even though you brought
quantum physics to America.

806
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:06,479
Which made me curious.

807
00:44:07,063 --> 00:44:08,272
What've you found out?

808
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:13,236
You're a dilettante, a womanizer,
a suspected communist--

809
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:14,612
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

810
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:16,364
I said "suspected."

811
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:20,493
Unstable, theatrical,
egotistical, neurotic--

812
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:23,412
Nothing good, no? Not
even, "He's brilliant, but--"

813
00:44:23,496 --> 00:44:26,874
Well, brilliance is taken for
granted in your circle, so no.

814
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:30,628
No, the only person who had anything
good to say was Richard Tolman.

815
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:32,630
Tolman thinks
you have integrity,

816
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:37,134
but he also strikes me as a guy who
knows more about science than people.

817
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:38,970
Yet here you are.

818
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:41,138
You don't take much on trust.

819
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:42,890
I don't take anything on trust.

820
00:44:46,894 --> 00:44:48,437
Why don't you
have a Nobel prize?

821
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:50,921
- Why aren't you a general?
- They're making me one for this.

822
00:44:50,982 --> 00:44:53,943
- Perhaps I'll have the same luck.
- A Nobel prize for making a bomb?

823
00:44:54,026 --> 00:44:55,903
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

824
00:44:58,781 --> 00:44:59,991
So how would you proceed?

825
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:06,622
You're talking about turning theory
into a practical weapons system

826
00:45:06,706 --> 00:45:07,999
faster than the Nazis.

827
00:45:08,082 --> 00:45:09,584
Who have a 12-month head start.

828
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:11,752
- Eighteen.
- How could you possibly know that?

829
00:45:11,836 --> 00:45:14,297
Our fast neutron
research took six months.

830
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,317
The man they've undoubtedly put in
charge will have made that leap instantly.

831
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:19,719
- Who do you think they put in charge?
- Werner Heisenberg.

832
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:24,056
He has the most intuitive understanding
of atomic structure I have ever seen.

833
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,641
- You know his work?
- I know him.

834
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:28,394
Just like I know Walther
Bothe, Von Weizsäcker, Diebner.

835
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:30,229
In a straight race,
the Germans win.

836
00:45:30,313 --> 00:45:31,397
We've got one hope.

837
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,690
Which is?

838
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:35,067
Anti-Semitism.

839
00:45:36,527 --> 00:45:37,528
What?

840
00:45:37,612 --> 00:45:40,364
Hitler called quantum
physics "Jewish science."

841
00:45:40,448 --> 00:45:41,782
Said it right to
Einstein's face.

842
00:45:41,866 --> 00:45:45,661
Our one hope is that Hitler
is so, so blinded by hate

843
00:45:45,745 --> 00:45:47,472
that he's denied
Heisenberg proper resources,

844
00:45:47,496 --> 00:45:49,332
because it'll take
vast resources.

845
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:51,018
Our nation's best
scientists, working together.

846
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:52,209
Right now, they're scattered.

847
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:54,086
Which gives us
compartmentalization.

848
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:57,089
All minds have to see the
whole task to contribute efficiently.

849
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:59,342
Poor security may
cost us the race.

850
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:00,718
Inefficiency will.

851
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,220
The Germans know
more than us anyway.

852
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:04,764
The Russians don't.

853
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:09,393
Remind me, who
are we at war with?

854
00:46:09,477 --> 00:46:12,730
Somebody with your past doesn't
wanna be seen downplaying

855
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:16,192
the importance of security
from our communist allies.

856
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:19,028
Point taken. But, no.

857
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:21,197
You don't get to say "no" to me.

858
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,449
It's my job to say "no" to
you when you're wrong.

859
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:25,493
So you have the job now?

860
00:46:25,576 --> 00:46:27,578
Uh, I'm considering it.

861
00:46:30,373 --> 00:46:32,875
I'm starting to see where
you got your reputation.

862
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:35,628
My favorite response?

863
00:46:36,379 --> 00:46:38,714
"Oppenheimer couldn't
run a hamburger stand."

864
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:41,592
[chuckles] I couldn't.

865
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:45,638
But I can run the
Manhattan Project.

866
00:46:47,181 --> 00:46:49,016
There's a way to
balance these things.

867
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:53,104
Keep the Rad Lab here at
Berkeley under Lawrence.

868
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:55,272
Met Lab in Chicago
under Szilard.

869
00:46:55,356 --> 00:46:57,733
Large scale refining, where
did you say? Tennessee.

870
00:46:57,817 --> 00:46:59,402
- And Hanford.
- And Hanford.

871
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:02,905
All America's industrial
might and scientific innovation,

872
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:05,074
connected by rail.

873
00:47:05,157 --> 00:47:06,659
Focused on one goal.

874
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:08,244
One point in space and time.

875
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:09,453
And it comes together here.

876
00:47:09,537 --> 00:47:10,955
A secret laboratory.

877
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:13,207
In the middle of nowhere,
secure, self-sufficient,

878
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,875
equipment, housing, the works.

879
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:16,544
Keep everyone
there until it's done.

880
00:47:17,294 --> 00:47:19,964
- I'll need the schools, stores, a church.
- Why?

881
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:23,175
If we don't let scientists bring their
families, we'll never get the best.

882
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:26,012
You want security,
build a town, build it fast.

883
00:47:26,095 --> 00:47:27,471
Where?

884
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:32,768
Welcome to Los Alamos.

885
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:35,521
Now, there's a boys' school
we'll have to commandeer

886
00:47:35,604 --> 00:47:37,374
and the local Indians
come up here for burial rites.

887
00:47:37,398 --> 00:47:39,191
But, apart from that, nothing.

888
00:47:39,275 --> 00:47:40,693
Forty miles. Any direction.

889
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:42,653
Enough to find the perfect spot.

890
00:47:42,737 --> 00:47:44,864
- What for?
- Success.

891
00:47:50,536 --> 00:47:52,288
Build him a town. Fast.

892
00:47:54,415 --> 00:47:56,208
Let's go recruit
some scientists.

893
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:59,920
- Why would I leave my family?
- I told you, you can bring your family.

894
00:48:00,004 --> 00:48:01,380
I'm not a soldier, Oppie.

895
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:03,591
A soldier? He's a general.

896
00:48:03,674 --> 00:48:05,342
I've got all the soldier I need.

897
00:48:05,426 --> 00:48:07,386
What can I tell them?

898
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,388
Heisenberg,
Diebner, Bothe, Bohr.

899
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:10,848
What do these men
have in common?

900
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,641
The greatest minds
on atomic theory.

901
00:48:12,725 --> 00:48:14,226
- Yes, and?
- Uh...

902
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:16,062
As much as you like...

903
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,190
until you feel my
boot on your balls.

904
00:48:20,232 --> 00:48:21,442
You know isotopes

905
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:23,861
and you know explosives,
better than anyone in the world.

906
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:25,544
But you can't tell
us what you're doing.

907
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:31,744
- I don't know.
- The Nazis have them.

908
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:33,954
- Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen.
- Under Nazi occupation.

909
00:48:34,038 --> 00:48:35,878
Did they stop printing
newspapers in Princeton?

910
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:39,710
Why would we go to the middle of
nowhere for who knows how long?

911
00:48:39,794 --> 00:48:41,545
A year or two. Or three.

912
00:48:42,922 --> 00:48:45,883
General, could you
give us a moment?

913
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:50,012
It's about unleashing
the strong force

914
00:48:51,555 --> 00:48:53,015
before the Nazis do.

915
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:54,975
Oh, my God.

916
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:57,353
- Niels won't work for the Nazis.
- No, never.

917
00:48:57,436 --> 00:48:59,688
But while they
have him, we don't.

918
00:48:59,772 --> 00:49:00,940
That's why I need you.

919
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:02,942
Why would you think I'd do that?

920
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:04,944
Why? Why?

921
00:49:05,027 --> 00:49:07,214
How about because this is
the most important fucking thing

922
00:49:07,238 --> 00:49:09,281
to ever happen in the
history of the world.

923
00:49:09,365 --> 00:49:11,826
How about that? Fuck.

924
00:49:17,123 --> 00:49:19,291
They are not gonna
let me onto this project.

925
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:23,796
And failing a security check is not gonna
be good for a career, even after the war.

926
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:25,506
So you're a fellow traveler.

927
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:28,134
So what? This is a
national emergency.

928
00:49:28,217 --> 00:49:31,262
I've got some skeletons,
they put me in charge.

929
00:49:31,345 --> 00:49:32,346
They need us.

930
00:49:32,429 --> 00:49:33,889
Until they don't.

931
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:40,187
Is there any chance of
getting Bohr out of Denmark?

932
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:41,397
[Groves] Nah, no dice.

933
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,649
I checked with the British.

934
00:49:43,732 --> 00:49:45,734
Until we get Allied boots
back onto the continent,

935
00:49:45,818 --> 00:49:46,818
there's just no way.

936
00:49:48,654 --> 00:49:49,780
Is he that important?

937
00:49:49,864 --> 00:49:52,908
How many people do you know
who've proved Einstein wrong?

938
00:49:54,285 --> 00:49:56,263
You know, it really would
be quicker to take a plane.

939
00:49:56,287 --> 00:49:57,830
No, plane's too risky.

940
00:49:57,913 --> 00:49:59,290
Country needs us.

941
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:02,001
[construction
equipment whirring]

942
00:50:02,877 --> 00:50:06,130
The Harvard guys, they say the
building's too small for the cyclotron.

943
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:10,426
Get them together
with the architects.

944
00:50:13,971 --> 00:50:15,723
When's this place
supposed to open?

945
00:50:18,726 --> 00:50:19,894
Two months.

946
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:24,356
Robert, you're the great
improviser, but this...

947
00:50:25,441 --> 00:50:26,734
you can't do in your head.

948
00:50:28,277 --> 00:50:29,570
Four divisions.

949
00:50:30,571 --> 00:50:34,158
Experimental, Theoretical,
Metallurgical, Ordnance.

950
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:35,326
Who's running Theoretical?

951
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:36,619
I am.

952
00:50:36,702 --> 00:50:39,538
That's what I was afraid
of. You're spread too thin.

953
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:42,374
So you take Theoretical.

954
00:50:45,294 --> 00:50:47,880
I'm not coming here, Robert.

955
00:50:54,053 --> 00:50:55,054
Why not?

956
00:51:01,894 --> 00:51:05,564
You drop a bomb and it falls
on the just, and the unjust.

957
00:51:06,941 --> 00:51:09,526
I don't wish the culmination
of three centuries of physics

958
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,528
to be a weapon of
mass destruction.

959
00:51:21,372 --> 00:51:22,498
Izzy.

960
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:27,670
I don't know if we can be
trusted with such a weapon.

961
00:51:29,255 --> 00:51:32,216
But I know the Nazis can't.

962
00:51:36,387 --> 00:51:37,554
We have no choice.

963
00:51:40,432 --> 00:51:41,433
Then...

964
00:51:43,227 --> 00:51:45,896
the second thing you'll have
to do is appoint Hans Bethe

965
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,690
to run the theoretical division.

966
00:51:49,984 --> 00:51:51,902
Wait, what was the first?

967
00:51:51,986 --> 00:51:55,489
Take off that ridiculous
uniform. You're a scientist.

968
00:51:55,572 --> 00:51:57,574
Groves is insisting we join.

969
00:51:57,658 --> 00:51:59,660
Tell Groves to
go shit in his hat.

970
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:01,787
They need us for who we are.

971
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,373
So be yourself. Only better.

972
00:52:44,705 --> 00:52:46,248
- This is the only key.
- [keys jangle]

973
00:52:46,332 --> 00:52:49,501
And Teller's already here.
Shall I just show him in?

974
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:52,629
- No, let's wait for the others.
- [door opens]

975
00:52:59,261 --> 00:53:00,262
Let's get started.

976
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,389
Hello, Edward.

977
00:53:02,473 --> 00:53:03,515
Yes.

978
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,934
Gentlemen, so, we will work here

979
00:53:06,018 --> 00:53:08,812
until the T-section at
Los Alamos is finished.

980
00:53:08,896 --> 00:53:09,897
Edward, can I please--

981
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,190
It is more important.

982
00:53:13,317 --> 00:53:17,363
When I calculated the chain reaction,
I found a rather troubling possibility.

983
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:21,033
No. This can't be right.

984
00:53:21,909 --> 00:53:23,428
Show me how you
did your calculations.

985
00:53:23,452 --> 00:53:24,453
[Edward] Yes.

986
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:31,543
- It's exponential.
- No. No, no, no. No.

987
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:36,507
This is fantasy.

988
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:38,634
Teller's calculations
can't be right.

989
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:41,470
Do them yourself
while I go to Princeton.

990
00:53:41,553 --> 00:53:43,555
- What for?
- To talk to Einstein.

991
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:45,933
There's not much common
ground between you two.

992
00:53:46,016 --> 00:53:47,434
That's why I
should get his view.

993
00:53:52,481 --> 00:53:54,441
- Albert.
- Mmm?

994
00:53:54,525 --> 00:53:57,361
Ah, Dr. Oppenheimer. [chuckles]

995
00:53:57,444 --> 00:54:00,531
Well, have you met Dr. Gödel?
We walk here most days.

996
00:54:00,614 --> 00:54:04,618
Trees are the most
inspiring structures.

997
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:06,745
Albert, might I have a word?

998
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:09,540
Of course. Excuse me, Kurt.

999
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:14,211
You know, some days,
Kurt refuses to eat.

1000
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:15,421
Even in Princeton.

1001
00:54:15,504 --> 00:54:18,841
He's convinced that the
Nazis can poison his food.

1002
00:54:20,217 --> 00:54:21,385
Hmm?

1003
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,722
Wha--

1004
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:33,063
Whose-- Whose work is this?

1005
00:54:33,147 --> 00:54:34,314
Teller's.

1006
00:54:35,399 --> 00:54:37,109
What do you take it to mean?

1007
00:54:37,901 --> 00:54:39,611
Neutrons smash into nucleus,

1008
00:54:39,695 --> 00:54:43,031
releasing neutrons to
smash into other nuclei.

1009
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:47,202
Criticality, a point of no
return, massive explosive force.

1010
00:54:47,744 --> 00:54:49,913
But this time, the chain
reaction doesn't stop.

1011
00:54:51,081 --> 00:54:53,208
It would ignite the atmosphere.

1012
00:54:55,169 --> 00:54:56,962
When we detonate
an atomic device,

1013
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:59,131
we might start a
chain reaction that...

1014
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:01,884
destroys the world.

1015
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:04,595
So here we are, hmm?

1016
00:55:04,678 --> 00:55:09,016
Lost in your quantum
world of probabilities

1017
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:10,434
and needing certainty.

1018
00:55:11,477 --> 00:55:13,687
Can you run the
calculations yourself?

1019
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:18,650
About the only thing you and I have in
common is a disdain for mathematics.

1020
00:55:18,734 --> 00:55:21,904
- Who's working on this in Berkeley?
- Hans Bethe.

1021
00:55:21,987 --> 00:55:24,239
Well, he'll get to the truth.

1022
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:28,160
And if the truth
is catastrophic?

1023
00:55:28,869 --> 00:55:30,078
Then you stop.

1024
00:55:30,162 --> 00:55:33,123
And you share your
findings with the Nazis.

1025
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:36,418
So neither side
destroys the world.

1026
00:55:40,255 --> 00:55:41,256
Robert.

1027
00:55:42,758 --> 00:55:44,885
This is yours, not mine.

1028
00:55:58,899 --> 00:56:00,275
[Bethe] Teller's wrong.

1029
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:02,194
- He's wrong.
- Shh, shh, shh...

1030
00:56:02,277 --> 00:56:03,779
[keys jangling]

1031
00:56:04,947 --> 00:56:06,114
[lock clicks]

1032
00:56:09,451 --> 00:56:10,536
[lock clicks]

1033
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:13,830
[Bethe] When you know
Teller's critical assumptions,

1034
00:56:13,914 --> 00:56:15,207
the real picture emerges.

1035
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,375
Bottom line?

1036
00:56:17,209 --> 00:56:20,212
The chances of an uncontrolled
nuclear reaction are near zero.

1037
00:56:20,295 --> 00:56:21,588
Near zero.

1038
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:24,466
Oppie, this is good news.

1039
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:25,592
Mmm.

1040
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,638
- Can you run them again?
- No, you'll get the same answer.

1041
00:56:29,721 --> 00:56:31,366
Till they actually detonate
one of these things,

1042
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:33,850
the best assurance
you're going to get is this.

1043
00:56:33,934 --> 00:56:34,935
Near zero.

1044
00:56:37,563 --> 00:56:40,315
- [sighs] Theory will take you only so far.
- Mmm.

1045
00:56:41,066 --> 00:56:43,735
- [Chevalier] Hello!
- Hello, you. We missed him.

1046
00:56:44,278 --> 00:56:46,530
- You want to adopt?
- She's kidding.

1047
00:56:46,613 --> 00:56:48,240
We wanted to see
you before we left.

1048
00:56:48,991 --> 00:56:51,201
For parts unknown.

1049
00:56:52,703 --> 00:56:55,664
You know who I ran into
the other day? Eltenton.

1050
00:56:56,331 --> 00:56:57,583
[Oppenheimer] Huh.

1051
00:56:57,666 --> 00:57:00,002
The chemist from
Shell? The union guy?

1052
00:57:00,085 --> 00:57:02,629
[Chevalier] Yeah. The FAECT guy.

1053
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:06,258
He was moaning about
how we're handling the war.

1054
00:57:07,384 --> 00:57:08,802
How so?

1055
00:57:08,885 --> 00:57:11,763
Lack of cooperation
with our allies.

1056
00:57:11,847 --> 00:57:15,976
Apparently our government's not
sharing any research with the Russians.

1057
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:19,855
Well, he said, "Most scientists
think the policy is stupid."

1058
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,152
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1059
00:57:25,736 --> 00:57:29,823
He mentioned that if anyone had
anything they wanted to pass on,

1060
00:57:30,699 --> 00:57:34,244
going around official
channels, that he could help.

1061
00:57:42,961 --> 00:57:44,212
That would be treason.

1062
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,798
Yes, of course.

1063
00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:49,176
I just thought you should know.

1064
00:57:51,803 --> 00:57:55,182
The brat is down.
Where are the martinis?

1065
00:58:00,562 --> 00:58:02,064
Coming right up.

1066
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:03,666
[Oppenheimer] The
conversation ended there.

1067
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:06,943
Nothing in our long-standing
friendship would have led me to believe

1068
00:58:07,027 --> 00:58:09,988
that Chevalier was
actually seeking information,

1069
00:58:10,072 --> 00:58:14,576
and I am certain that he had no idea
of the work in which I was engaged.

1070
00:58:19,373 --> 00:58:20,999
It has long been clear to me

1071
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:24,169
that I should have reported
this incident at once.

1072
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:26,963
[McGee] The Oppenheimer
situation highlights the tension

1073
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:30,300
between scientists and
the security apparatus.

1074
00:58:30,384 --> 00:58:32,719
In hopes of learning how the
nominee handled such issues

1075
00:58:32,803 --> 00:58:34,846
during his time at the AEC,

1076
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:37,683
we'll have a scientist
appearing before the committee.

1077
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,353
- Who are they bringing in?
- They haven't said.

1078
00:58:41,436 --> 00:58:42,646
Mr. Chairman, if I may,

1079
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:45,315
I'm nominated for
commerce secretary.

1080
00:58:45,399 --> 00:58:47,609
Why seek the
opinion of scientists?

1081
00:58:47,693 --> 00:58:49,903
This is a cabinet post, Admiral.

1082
00:58:49,986 --> 00:58:52,698
We seek a wide range of opinion.

1083
00:58:52,781 --> 00:58:55,093
Well, I'd like to know the
name of the scientist testifying,

1084
00:58:55,117 --> 00:58:56,597
I'd like the chance
to cross-examine.

1085
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:58,787
This is not a court.

1086
00:59:00,163 --> 00:59:01,164
Formality, huh?

1087
00:59:01,248 --> 00:59:04,960
No presidential Cabinet nominee
has failed to be confirmed since 1925.

1088
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:07,212
This is just how
the game is played.

1089
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:09,673
It's in the bag,
Lewis. So play nice.

1090
00:59:10,257 --> 00:59:11,967
They bring in a
scientist, so what?

1091
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,927
You don't know scientists
like I do, Counselor.

1092
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,179
They resent anyone who
questions their judgment,

1093
00:59:16,263 --> 00:59:18,223
especially if you're
not one of them.

1094
00:59:18,306 --> 00:59:19,766
I was chair of the AEC.

1095
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,935
I'm easy to blame for
what happened to Robert.

1096
00:59:22,018 --> 00:59:24,299
We can't have the Senate
thinking the scientific community

1097
00:59:24,354 --> 00:59:25,814
doesn't support you, sir.

1098
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,900
- Or should we pivot?
- [Senate aide] To what?

1099
00:59:28,984 --> 00:59:30,444
And embrace it.

1100
00:59:30,527 --> 00:59:33,155
"I fought Oppenheimer
and the US won."

1101
00:59:33,238 --> 00:59:34,823
I-I don't think we
need to go there.

1102
00:59:34,906 --> 00:59:37,051
Isn't there someone we can call
who knows what really happened?

1103
00:59:37,075 --> 00:59:38,660
- Teller.
- He'll make an impression.

1104
00:59:38,744 --> 00:59:40,638
Can you get the name of
the scientist they've called?

1105
00:59:40,662 --> 00:59:41,538
Probably.

1106
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:44,666
Find out if he was based in
Chicago or Los Alamos during the war.

1107
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:45,959
Why does that matter?

1108
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:48,754
If he was based in Chicago, he
worked under Szilard and Fermi,

1109
00:59:48,837 --> 00:59:50,881
not the cult of
Oppie at Los Alamos.

1110
00:59:50,964 --> 00:59:52,424
Robert built that damn place.

1111
00:59:52,507 --> 00:59:56,511
He was founder, mayor,
sheriff, all rolled into one.

1112
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:05,937
- [officer chattering on loudspeaker]
- [Peter crying]

1113
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,859
All it needs is a saloon.

1114
01:00:10,942 --> 01:00:12,319
[Peter continues crying]

1115
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:37,552
[murmurs]

1116
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:39,679
Let's go and see.

1117
01:00:40,597 --> 01:00:41,807
There's no kitchen.

1118
01:00:43,058 --> 01:00:45,310
Really? We'll fix that.

1119
01:00:52,317 --> 01:00:56,238
Barbed wire? Guns? Oppie.

1120
01:00:56,738 --> 01:00:58,323
[Oppenheimer]
We're at war, Hans.

1121
01:01:00,826 --> 01:01:03,495
Halifax, 1917.

1122
01:01:03,578 --> 01:01:06,164
A cargo ship carrying
munitions explodes in the harbor.

1123
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:11,628
A vast and sudden
chemical reaction.

1124
01:01:15,423 --> 01:01:18,134
The biggest man-made
explosion in history.

1125
01:01:18,802 --> 01:01:21,555
Now let's calculate how much
more destructive it would have been

1126
01:01:21,638 --> 01:01:25,225
if it were a nuclear, and
not a chemical, reaction.

1127
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:28,270
Expressing power in
terms of tons of TNT.

1128
01:01:28,353 --> 01:01:29,771
But it will be thousands.

1129
01:01:30,355 --> 01:01:32,941
Well, then... kilotons.

1130
01:01:36,903 --> 01:01:41,324
- Using U-235, the bomb will need--
- Ah...

1131
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:43,451
Right, sorry.

1132
01:01:43,535 --> 01:01:47,414
Gadget will need a 33-pound
sphere about this size.

1133
01:01:47,497 --> 01:01:51,126
Or using plutonium,
the ten-pound sphere.

1134
01:01:52,669 --> 01:01:56,673
Here's the amount of uranium
Oak Ridge refined all of last month.

1135
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:03,388
And the Hanford plant
made this much plutonium.

1136
01:02:05,724 --> 01:02:09,436
Now, if we can enrich these amounts,
we need a way to detonate them.

1137
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:10,687
[paper rips]

1138
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,147
Are we boring you, Edward?

1139
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:14,357
A little bit, yes.

1140
01:02:14,441 --> 01:02:15,775
May I ask why?

1141
01:02:15,859 --> 01:02:19,154
We all entered this room knowing
a fission bomb was possible.

1142
01:02:19,905 --> 01:02:22,866
- How about we leave it with something new?
- Such as?

1143
01:02:22,949 --> 01:02:26,661
Instead of uranium or
plutonium, we use hydrogen.

1144
01:02:26,745 --> 01:02:27,871
[all murmuring]

1145
01:02:27,954 --> 01:02:29,414
Heavy hydrogen.

1146
01:02:29,998 --> 01:02:31,082
Deuterium.

1147
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:32,626
You see?

1148
01:02:32,709 --> 01:02:35,378
We compact the atoms
together under great pressure

1149
01:02:35,462 --> 01:02:37,380
to induce a fusion reaction.

1150
01:02:38,465 --> 01:02:41,092
Then we'll get not kilotons,

1151
01:02:41,176 --> 01:02:42,260
but megatons.

1152
01:02:43,345 --> 01:02:45,180
Okay, hang on, hang on.

1153
01:02:45,263 --> 01:02:49,142
So how do you generate enough
force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

1154
01:02:50,268 --> 01:02:51,728
A small fission bomb.

1155
01:02:52,479 --> 01:02:53,605
- Ah...
- There we are!

1156
01:02:53,688 --> 01:02:55,482
[applause, laughter]

1157
01:02:55,565 --> 01:02:57,209
Well, since we're going
to need one anyway,

1158
01:02:57,233 --> 01:02:59,194
can we get back to
the business at hand?

1159
01:02:59,277 --> 01:03:00,445
[Bartlett] The isotopes issue

1160
01:03:00,528 --> 01:03:05,533
wasn't your most important policy
disagreement with Dr. Oppenheimer,

1161
01:03:05,617 --> 01:03:08,161
it was the hydrogen
bomb, wasn't it?

1162
01:03:08,244 --> 01:03:13,375
As colleagues, we agreed to
disagree on a great many things, uh,

1163
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:17,253
and, well, one of them was the
need for an H-bomb program, yes.

1164
01:03:17,921 --> 01:03:19,214
[siren wailing]

1165
01:03:30,684 --> 01:03:33,269
[Strauss] Thanks for
convening on short notice.

1166
01:03:33,353 --> 01:03:34,771
I can't believe it.

1167
01:03:36,022 --> 01:03:37,315
Here we are.

1168
01:03:37,399 --> 01:03:39,359
Catch me up. What do we know?

1169
01:03:39,442 --> 01:03:43,530
One of our B-29s over the North
Pacific has detected radiation.

1170
01:03:43,613 --> 01:03:45,198
Do we have the filter paper?

1171
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:48,159
- There's no doubt what this is.
- White House says there's a doubt.

1172
01:03:48,243 --> 01:03:49,661
Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

1173
01:03:49,744 --> 01:03:52,539
Are those the long-range
detection filter papers?

1174
01:03:53,498 --> 01:03:54,833
It's an atomic test.

1175
01:03:58,503 --> 01:04:00,213
The Russians have a bomb.

1176
01:04:00,296 --> 01:04:03,633
We're supposed to be years
ahead of them, but some--

1177
01:04:03,717 --> 01:04:07,137
What were you guys doing at
Los Alamos? Wasn't security tight?

1178
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:10,060
- Of course it was. You weren't there.
- [Nichols] Forgive me, Doctor...

1179
01:04:11,933 --> 01:04:13,184
but I was there.

1180
01:04:14,144 --> 01:04:17,772
We can now consider the
actual mechanics of detonation.

1181
01:04:17,856 --> 01:04:19,149
[Oppenheimer] Any ideas?

1182
01:04:19,232 --> 01:04:20,567
[Serber] I call this "shooting."

1183
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:24,279
We fire a chunk of fissionable
material into a larger sphere

1184
01:04:24,362 --> 01:04:26,906
with enough force
to achieve criticality.

1185
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:28,700
What do we think? Anyone?

1186
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:30,503
[Tolman] I've been
thinking about implosion.

1187
01:04:30,535 --> 01:04:33,538
Explosives around the sphere
blast inwards, crushing the material.

1188
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:36,458
I'd like to
investigate that idea.

1189
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:38,710
I'll talk to Ordnance, get
you blowing things up.

1190
01:04:39,961 --> 01:04:41,921
- [Groves] Progress?
- Nice to see you too.

1191
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:44,674
Meet the British contingent.

1192
01:04:44,758 --> 01:04:46,426
Dr. Oppenheimer, Klaus Fuchs.

1193
01:04:46,509 --> 01:04:48,303
How long have you been British?

1194
01:04:48,386 --> 01:04:50,555
- Since Hitler told me I wasn't German.
- Aha.

1195
01:04:51,264 --> 01:04:52,932
Come, welcome to Los Alamos.

1196
01:04:53,475 --> 01:04:55,226
School's up and running.

1197
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:57,312
Bar... always running.

1198
01:04:58,396 --> 01:05:00,523
And I thought of a way
to reduce support staff.

1199
01:05:01,983 --> 01:05:03,777
- Is that--
- [Oppenheimer] Mrs. Serber, yes.

1200
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:07,322
I've offered jobs to all the wives.
Admin, librarians, computation.

1201
01:05:07,405 --> 01:05:09,532
We cut down on staff,
keep families together.

1202
01:05:09,616 --> 01:05:10,784
Are these women qualified?

1203
01:05:10,867 --> 01:05:13,953
Don't be absurd. These are some of
the brightest minds in our community.

1204
01:05:14,037 --> 01:05:15,747
And they're already
security cleared.

1205
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:16,891
I've informed General Groves

1206
01:05:16,915 --> 01:05:19,435
you've been holding cross-divisional,
open discussions on a nightly basis.

1207
01:05:19,459 --> 01:05:20,710
Shut them down.

1208
01:05:20,794 --> 01:05:23,379
Compartmentalization is the
key to maintaining security--

1209
01:05:23,463 --> 01:05:24,380
[Condon] It's only the top men.

1210
01:05:24,464 --> 01:05:26,424
Who presumably
communicate with subordinates.

1211
01:05:26,508 --> 01:05:28,384
These men aren't stupid.
They can be discreet.

1212
01:05:28,468 --> 01:05:29,468
I don't like it.

1213
01:05:29,511 --> 01:05:32,180
You don't like anything
enough for that to be a fair test.

1214
01:05:38,103 --> 01:05:40,605
Once a week. Top men only.

1215
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:43,108
- I'd like to bring my brother here.
- No.

1216
01:05:44,692 --> 01:05:45,777
Nichols...

1217
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:49,948
I still haven't heard that my security
clearance has been approved.

1218
01:05:50,031 --> 01:05:51,950
- It hasn't.
- We're going to Chicago tomorrow.

1219
01:05:52,033 --> 01:05:53,701
Well, you should wait.

1220
01:05:53,785 --> 01:05:56,329
You are aware that the Nazis
have a two-year head start?

1221
01:05:56,412 --> 01:05:58,307
Dr. Oppenheimer, the fact
that your security clearance

1222
01:05:58,331 --> 01:06:00,375
is proving difficult to
obtain is not my fault.

1223
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:01,793
It's yours.

1224
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:03,604
May not be your fault,
but it's your problem.

1225
01:06:03,628 --> 01:06:05,088
Because I'm going.

1226
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:07,298
[Strauss] And how many
people were in these, uh,

1227
01:06:08,091 --> 01:06:09,884
open discussions?

1228
01:06:09,968 --> 01:06:12,363
Too many. Compartmentalization
was supposed to be the protocol.

1229
01:06:12,387 --> 01:06:14,180
We were in a race
against the Nazis.

1230
01:06:14,264 --> 01:06:17,475
- And now the race is against the Soviets.
- Not unless we start it.

1231
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:21,604
Robert, they just
fired a starting gun.

1232
01:06:21,688 --> 01:06:23,898
What's the nature of the
device they detonated?

1233
01:06:23,982 --> 01:06:27,485
The data indicates it may have
been a plutonium implosion device.

1234
01:06:27,569 --> 01:06:30,697
Like the one you
built at Los Alamos.

1235
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,700
The Russians have a bomb,
Truman needs to know what's next.

1236
01:06:33,783 --> 01:06:35,660
What's next? Arms talks.

1237
01:06:35,743 --> 01:06:37,203
- Arms talks.
- Obviously.

1238
01:06:38,413 --> 01:06:39,664
What about the Super?

1239
01:06:39,747 --> 01:06:43,376
Does Truman even know
about it? Did we brief him on that?

1240
01:06:43,459 --> 01:06:44,544
Not specifically.

1241
01:06:44,627 --> 01:06:47,589
We still don't know if a hydrogen
bomb's technically feasible.

1242
01:06:47,672 --> 01:06:49,757
My understanding is
that Teller proposed it?

1243
01:06:49,841 --> 01:06:51,426
- [Oppenheimer] Yes.
- At Los Alamos?

1244
01:06:51,509 --> 01:06:53,529
Teller's designs have
always been wildly impractical.

1245
01:06:53,553 --> 01:06:55,555
You'd have to
deliver by ox cart.

1246
01:06:55,638 --> 01:06:57,557
- Not airplane.
- [Lawrence] Oppie.

1247
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,893
I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence.
Do you want to comment?

1248
01:07:01,686 --> 01:07:02,770
No.

1249
01:07:04,439 --> 01:07:07,025
Because if it can
put us ahead again,

1250
01:07:07,108 --> 01:07:12,197
the President of the United
States needs to know about it.

1251
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,698
[scoffs]

1252
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:18,661
And if the Russians know about it
already from a spy at Los Alamos,

1253
01:07:18,745 --> 01:07:19,805
then we've gotta get going.

1254
01:07:19,829 --> 01:07:22,749
There's no proof there
was a spy at Los Alamos.

1255
01:07:22,832 --> 01:07:23,833
Robert.

1256
01:07:28,463 --> 01:07:30,548
They put it under
the football stadium?

1257
01:07:30,632 --> 01:07:32,508
The field's not in use anymore.

1258
01:07:32,592 --> 01:07:33,843
Just as well.

1259
01:07:36,638 --> 01:07:38,514
- Oppie.
- Dr. Fermi.

1260
01:07:38,598 --> 01:07:40,683
Come stai? Va bene?

1261
01:07:41,392 --> 01:07:44,354
- I hear you got a little town.
- Yes. Come and see.

1262
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:45,438
[Szilard chuckles]

1263
01:07:45,521 --> 01:07:48,775
Who could think straight
in a place like that? Huh?

1264
01:07:49,692 --> 01:07:51,653
Everybody will go crazy.

1265
01:07:52,487 --> 01:07:54,781
Thank you for the vote
of confidence, Szilard.

1266
01:07:56,157 --> 01:07:58,701
Do we really-- Do we
really need that in the notes?

1267
01:07:59,452 --> 01:08:01,454
When are you
going to try it out?

1268
01:08:01,537 --> 01:08:03,206
We did.

1269
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:06,542
[Fermi] The first self-sustaining
nuclear chain reaction.

1270
01:08:07,335 --> 01:08:08,711
Didn't Groves tell you?

1271
01:08:08,795 --> 01:08:10,463
- [Geiger counter humming]
- No.

1272
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,679
[soldier] One at a time,
please. One at a time.

1273
01:08:18,221 --> 01:08:19,472
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1274
01:08:20,223 --> 01:08:23,226
I tried Personnel. They
asked if I could type.

1275
01:08:23,309 --> 01:08:24,477
Can you?

1276
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,188
Harvard forgot to teach that on
the graduate chemistry course.

1277
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:31,734
Condon, put Mrs. Hornig
here on the plutonium team.

1278
01:08:37,115 --> 01:08:39,409
What the hell were
you doing in Chicago?

1279
01:08:39,492 --> 01:08:40,702
Visiting the Met?

1280
01:08:40,785 --> 01:08:41,828
Why?

1281
01:08:41,911 --> 01:08:43,955
- Why?
- Because we have every right--

1282
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:47,709
You have just the rights that
I give you. No more, no less.

1283
01:08:48,293 --> 01:08:50,211
We are adults trying
to run a project here.

1284
01:08:50,295 --> 01:08:51,838
This is ridiculous.

1285
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:52,922
Tell him.

1286
01:08:54,507 --> 01:08:57,302
Compartmentalization is
the protocol we agreed to.

1287
01:08:58,553 --> 01:08:59,762
Enough of this madhouse.

1288
01:08:59,846 --> 01:09:01,764
Nobody can work
under these conditions.

1289
01:09:01,848 --> 01:09:04,726
You know what, Generalissimo?

1290
01:09:04,809 --> 01:09:06,185
I quit.

1291
01:09:06,269 --> 01:09:07,478
Thanks for nothing.

1292
01:09:09,731 --> 01:09:11,274
[Groves] Better off without him.

1293
01:09:11,357 --> 01:09:12,400
[door slams]

1294
01:09:12,483 --> 01:09:15,528
Aren't you more concerned
about his discretion out there?

1295
01:09:16,654 --> 01:09:18,114
We'll have him killed.

1296
01:09:19,991 --> 01:09:21,409
I was just kidding. [chuckles]

1297
01:09:21,993 --> 01:09:23,786
No, he hates me, not America.

1298
01:09:24,412 --> 01:09:27,332
You know, General, not everyone
has levers to pull like mine.

1299
01:09:27,415 --> 01:09:28,750
I don't think I understand.

1300
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:31,419
You didn't hire me
despite my left-wing past,

1301
01:09:31,502 --> 01:09:33,087
you hired me because of it.

1302
01:09:34,047 --> 01:09:36,007
So you could control me.

1303
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:38,676
Well, I'm not that subtle.

1304
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,261
I'm just a humble soldier.

1305
01:09:40,345 --> 01:09:42,347
You're neither humble,
nor just a soldier.

1306
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:45,183
- You studied engineering at MIT.
- Guilty as charged.

1307
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:46,660
Well, now we
understand each other,

1308
01:09:46,684 --> 01:09:48,329
perhaps you can get
me my security clearance

1309
01:09:48,353 --> 01:09:50,438
so I can perform
this miracle for you.

1310
01:09:56,361 --> 01:09:58,756
[attorney] General Groves, were
you aware of Dr. Oppenheimer's

1311
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,240
left-wing associations
when you appointed him?

1312
01:10:01,324 --> 01:10:03,469
[Groves] I was aware that
there were suspicions about him.

1313
01:10:03,493 --> 01:10:06,579
I was aware he had a very
extreme, liberal background.

1314
01:10:06,662 --> 01:10:09,624
In your opinion, would he ever
consciously commit a disloyal act?

1315
01:10:09,707 --> 01:10:11,626
I would be amazed if he did.

1316
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:14,504
[attorney] So you had complete
confidence in his integrity?

1317
01:10:14,587 --> 01:10:17,173
At Los Alamos, yes, which
is where I really knew him.

1318
01:10:17,256 --> 01:10:19,926
General, did your security
officers on the project

1319
01:10:20,009 --> 01:10:22,261
advise you against the
clearance of Dr. Oppenheimer?

1320
01:10:22,345 --> 01:10:26,307
They could not and would
not clear him until I insisted.

1321
01:10:26,391 --> 01:10:28,118
And it's safe to say that you
had a pretty good knowledge

1322
01:10:28,142 --> 01:10:29,852
of Dr. Oppenheimer's
security file.

1323
01:10:29,936 --> 01:10:31,020
I did.

1324
01:10:31,604 --> 01:10:34,190
There's only really one question
I need answered here today.

1325
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:38,861
In light of the current AEC guidelines,
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1326
01:10:38,945 --> 01:10:40,738
Do you have the guidelines?

1327
01:10:48,204 --> 01:10:53,960
[Robb] Under current AEC guidelines,
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1328
01:10:54,627 --> 01:10:57,839
- [rooster crows]
- [car approaching]

1329
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:05,054
[car door opens, closes]

1330
01:11:05,763 --> 01:11:07,432
Physics and New Mexico, huh?

1331
01:11:07,515 --> 01:11:08,766
[chuckles]

1332
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:09,851
My God.

1333
01:11:10,393 --> 01:11:11,894
What a trek.

1334
01:11:11,978 --> 01:11:13,312
That's why you need a liaison.

1335
01:11:13,396 --> 01:11:14,772
I'm appointing Lomanitz.

1336
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,066
You're gonna be okay.

1337
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:18,401
This way, gentlemen.

1338
01:11:20,653 --> 01:11:22,363
[beakers clinking]

1339
01:11:22,447 --> 01:11:24,282
[gas hissing]

1340
01:11:28,453 --> 01:11:30,246
- Dr. Lawrence.
- Leslie.

1341
01:11:30,788 --> 01:11:32,850
I'd like to remind you what
we talked about in Berkeley.

1342
01:11:32,874 --> 01:11:34,750
Compartmentalization.
I understand completely.

1343
01:11:38,254 --> 01:11:39,380
[chattering]

1344
01:11:40,673 --> 01:11:41,674
Thank you.

1345
01:11:46,471 --> 01:11:48,514
[all cheering]

1346
01:11:50,141 --> 01:11:51,535
[Lawrence] Greetings
from Berkeley.

1347
01:11:51,559 --> 01:11:54,896
I am here to update you on our
progress and solicit your input.

1348
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:57,190
To do so, I am going to
have to share a few things

1349
01:11:57,273 --> 01:11:59,942
that General Groves
told me not to.

1350
01:12:00,026 --> 01:12:02,862
Sorry, General, I said I
understood, not that I agreed.

1351
01:12:02,945 --> 01:12:04,447
- [all chuckling]
- [Lawrence] Okay.

1352
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:06,073
Gentlemen, to business.

1353
01:12:06,657 --> 01:12:09,202
There were rumors of
espionage at Los Alamos.

1354
01:12:09,285 --> 01:12:10,411
Unsubstantiated.

1355
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:13,581
[Strauss] I'm told that there
were communists on the project.

1356
01:12:13,664 --> 01:12:15,917
We didn't knowingly
employ any communists.

1357
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,336
Were any of them involved
in discussions of the Super?

1358
01:12:18,419 --> 01:12:21,005
I seem to remember you demanding
your brother come to Los Alamos.

1359
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:22,757
My brother had left
the Party by then.

1360
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,841
What about Lomanitz?

1361
01:12:23,925 --> 01:12:26,886
Lomanitz was never employed
at Los Alamos. He was a liaison.

1362
01:12:26,969 --> 01:12:29,764
Our security was tight, as
former Colonel Nichols well knows.

1363
01:12:29,847 --> 01:12:32,618
Our security was as tight as it could
be given the personalities involved,

1364
01:12:32,642 --> 01:12:33,893
but attempts were made.

1365
01:12:33,976 --> 01:12:36,812
- What is that supposed to mean?
- We've all read his file here.

1366
01:12:37,647 --> 01:12:39,815
Do we need to talk
about Jean Tatlock?

1367
01:12:40,733 --> 01:12:42,944
Or the Chevalier incident?

1368
01:12:47,365 --> 01:12:48,449
Excuse me.

1369
01:12:50,284 --> 01:12:53,246
- [phone ringing]
- [secretary] That's Lomanitz, on line one.

1370
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:00,962
Hello, Rossi.

1371
01:13:01,045 --> 01:13:04,048
What? Okay, just calm down.

1372
01:13:05,091 --> 01:13:06,384
There's been another screw-up.

1373
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:08,135
Lomanitz just got drafted.

1374
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:10,846
- We are at war, Doctor.
- Don't be an asshole, Nichols.

1375
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:12,932
We need this
kid. Fix it, will you?

1376
01:13:13,015 --> 01:13:14,392
It wasn't a mistake.

1377
01:13:14,475 --> 01:13:17,270
Your friend Lomanitz has been
trying to unionize the Radiation Lab.

1378
01:13:17,353 --> 01:13:18,980
He promised to quit all that.

1379
01:13:19,063 --> 01:13:20,439
Well, he hasn't.

1380
01:13:21,232 --> 01:13:24,235
Security officer at Berkeley's
concerned about communist infiltration

1381
01:13:24,318 --> 01:13:26,153
through that union, the FA--

1382
01:13:26,237 --> 01:13:28,072
FAECT.

1383
01:13:30,533 --> 01:13:32,785
Well, I'm there
next week, I'll...

1384
01:13:32,868 --> 01:13:34,203
drop in to see him.

1385
01:13:36,205 --> 01:13:37,832
Your Q clearance came through.

1386
01:13:41,752 --> 01:13:45,256
It's important you not maintain or
renew any questionable associations.

1387
01:13:50,094 --> 01:13:52,179
[Robb] Doctor, did
you think social contacts

1388
01:13:52,263 --> 01:13:56,350
between a person engaged on secret
war work and communists was dangerous?

1389
01:13:56,434 --> 01:13:59,437
My awareness of the danger
would be greater today.

1390
01:14:00,187 --> 01:14:03,024
I mean, it's fair to say
that during the war years,

1391
01:14:03,107 --> 01:14:06,319
you felt that such contacts
were potentially dangerous?

1392
01:14:11,407 --> 01:14:12,658
[elevator bell dings]

1393
01:14:12,742 --> 01:14:15,077
[Oppenheimer] Were
conceivably dangerous, yes.

1394
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:19,290
[Robb] I mean, really?
Known communists?

1395
01:14:22,251 --> 01:14:23,252
[Oppenheimer] Look...

1396
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:28,591
I've had a lot of secrets
in my head for a long time.

1397
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:34,013
Doesn't matter who I associate
with. I don't talk about those secrets.

1398
01:14:41,646 --> 01:14:43,272
[Robb] You said
in your statement

1399
01:14:44,357 --> 01:14:45,483
that you had

1400
01:14:46,609 --> 01:14:48,903
to see Jean Tatlock in 1943.

1401
01:14:50,696 --> 01:14:52,073
You left.

1402
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:54,700
Not a word.

1403
01:14:55,368 --> 01:14:57,370
What did you think
that would do to me?

1404
01:14:58,663 --> 01:14:59,664
I wrote.

1405
01:14:59,747 --> 01:15:01,749
Pages of nothing.

1406
01:15:04,251 --> 01:15:06,003
Where did you go?

1407
01:15:07,713 --> 01:15:09,215
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

1408
01:15:09,298 --> 01:15:10,841
Because you're a communist.

1409
01:15:13,469 --> 01:15:15,471
Why did you have to see her?

1410
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:20,309
Because she had indicated a
great desire to see me before we left.

1411
01:15:20,393 --> 01:15:25,022
At that time, I couldn't, but I
felt that she had to see me.

1412
01:15:25,106 --> 01:15:27,775
She was undergoing
psychiatric treatment.

1413
01:15:27,858 --> 01:15:29,902
She was extremely unhappy.

1414
01:15:29,985 --> 01:15:32,196
Did you find out why
she had to see you?

1415
01:15:37,159 --> 01:15:39,245
Because she was
still in love with me.

1416
01:15:46,627 --> 01:15:48,379
Spent the night
together, didn't you?

1417
01:15:56,429 --> 01:15:57,513
[Oppenheimer] Yes.

1418
01:16:03,894 --> 01:16:06,939
You drop in and out of my life

1419
01:16:07,022 --> 01:16:09,483
and you don't
have to tell me why.

1420
01:16:09,567 --> 01:16:10,943
Now, that's power.

1421
01:16:11,026 --> 01:16:13,070
Not that I enjoy.

1422
01:16:13,863 --> 01:16:16,282
I'd rather be here
for you as you need.

1423
01:16:16,365 --> 01:16:18,784
But you have
other priorities now.

1424
01:16:19,577 --> 01:16:21,370
I have a wife and child.

1425
01:16:22,663 --> 01:16:25,082
That's not what either
of us is talking about.

1426
01:16:28,836 --> 01:16:29,879
Jean.

1427
01:16:30,755 --> 01:16:32,298
You asked me to come.

1428
01:16:33,424 --> 01:16:35,050
And I'm glad I did.

1429
01:16:35,926 --> 01:16:37,595
But I can't see you again.

1430
01:16:40,931 --> 01:16:42,600
But what if I need you?

1431
01:16:46,562 --> 01:16:48,564
You said you would
always answer.

1432
01:16:51,442 --> 01:16:52,693
Not a word.

1433
01:16:53,819 --> 01:16:56,155
[Robb] Did you think that
consistent with good security?

1434
01:16:56,238 --> 01:16:59,116
- [rhythmic thudding]
- As a matter of fact, it was. Not a word.

1435
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,618
[thudding intensifies]

1436
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:02,411
[Robb] When did
you see her after that?

1437
01:17:08,834 --> 01:17:10,085
[thudding stops]

1438
01:17:10,753 --> 01:17:12,254
I never saw her again.

1439
01:17:18,844 --> 01:17:21,222
I can make the last
train back to Princeton.

1440
01:17:21,972 --> 01:17:24,517
Kitty, I didn't say anything
that I hadn't already told you.

1441
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,770
- Today you said it to history, didn't you?
- This is a closed hearing.

1442
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:32,566
If they don't release the
transcript, I'm sure you will.

1443
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:33,651
I was under oath.

1444
01:17:33,734 --> 01:17:36,737
Well, you were under an oath to
me when you went to see Jean.

1445
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:39,156
You know, you...

1446
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:41,450
you sit there,

1447
01:17:41,534 --> 01:17:42,535
day after day,

1448
01:17:43,661 --> 01:17:45,996
letting them pick
our lives to pieces.

1449
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,875
Why won't you fight?

1450
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:56,131
[attorney] Robert, I'm
not putting her up there.

1451
01:18:01,846 --> 01:18:04,598
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an
honor. Please, take a seat.

1452
01:18:04,682 --> 01:18:06,475
No need, I just wanted to check

1453
01:18:06,559 --> 01:18:10,521
whether I should talk to Lomanitz
while I'm here, given your concerns.

1454
01:18:10,604 --> 01:18:13,482
Well, I'd say that's really up to
you, Professor, but I'd be cautious.

1455
01:18:13,566 --> 01:18:14,900
Uh-huh. Understood.

1456
01:18:14,984 --> 01:18:17,528
Oh, and, um... [clears throat]
...as regards to the union,

1457
01:18:17,611 --> 01:18:21,156
I wanted to give you a heads-up
on a man named Eltenton.

1458
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,783
- A heads-up?
- Yes.

1459
01:18:22,867 --> 01:18:25,703
Just that he might
merit watching, is all.

1460
01:18:27,246 --> 01:18:28,622
I'd love to get more details.

1461
01:18:28,706 --> 01:18:32,042
Well, I have an appointment
now, and I leave early tomorrow.

1462
01:18:32,126 --> 01:18:35,713
Well, come back as early as you
like. Since you haven't time now.

1463
01:18:36,881 --> 01:18:38,507
You went back the next morning.

1464
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,551
I did. I had to, really.

1465
01:18:41,343 --> 01:18:42,761
This time there was another man.

1466
01:18:45,014 --> 01:18:46,348
He said his name was Pash.

1467
01:18:46,432 --> 01:18:49,018
Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

1468
01:18:49,101 --> 01:18:54,231
[Robb] Colonel Pash, could you please
read from your memo dated June 29, 1943?

1469
01:18:55,983 --> 01:18:58,444
[Pash] "Results of surveillance
conducted on subject

1470
01:18:58,527 --> 01:19:01,405
indicate further possible
Communist Party connections.

1471
01:19:01,488 --> 01:19:03,824
Subject met with, and
spent considerable time with,

1472
01:19:03,908 --> 01:19:05,784
one Jean Tatlock, communist,

1473
01:19:05,868 --> 01:19:07,286
the record of whom is attached."

1474
01:19:07,369 --> 01:19:09,955
- The subject being Dr. Oppenheimer?
- [Pash] Yes.

1475
01:19:10,039 --> 01:19:11,707
[Robb] Whom you had not met?

1476
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:13,125
[Pash] Not then, but soon after.

1477
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:15,753
He's the head of security for
the project. Shouldn't I know him?

1478
01:19:15,836 --> 01:19:19,381
No, he should know you. I would
never put you in a room with Pash.

1479
01:19:19,465 --> 01:19:20,465
Why not?

1480
01:19:21,008 --> 01:19:22,885
When Pash first
heard about Lomanitz,

1481
01:19:22,968 --> 01:19:25,888
he told the FBI he
was gonna kidnap him,

1482
01:19:25,971 --> 01:19:27,723
take him out on a boat,

1483
01:19:27,806 --> 01:19:30,184
and interrogate him
in the Russian manner.

1484
01:19:33,228 --> 01:19:35,457
General Groves has placed
in me a certain responsibility,

1485
01:19:35,481 --> 01:19:37,650
and it's like having a
child who I can't see.

1486
01:19:38,692 --> 01:19:40,027
By remote control.

1487
01:19:41,362 --> 01:19:42,738
So to actually meet you is...

1488
01:19:44,698 --> 01:19:46,979
- I won't take up too much of your time.
- No, not at all.

1489
01:19:47,034 --> 01:19:48,243
Whatever time you choose.

1490
01:19:49,495 --> 01:19:51,655
Mr. Johnson told me of a
conversation you had yesterday

1491
01:19:51,705 --> 01:19:52,998
in which I'm very interested.

1492
01:19:53,082 --> 01:19:55,292
It's had me worried all day.

1493
01:19:55,376 --> 01:19:58,921
Yes, well, I didn't want to talk to
Lomanitz without authorization.

1494
01:19:59,004 --> 01:20:00,923
That's not the particular
interest that I have.

1495
01:20:01,006 --> 01:20:02,466
It's something
a little bit more...

1496
01:20:03,968 --> 01:20:05,427
in my opinion, more serious.

1497
01:20:05,511 --> 01:20:08,305
Now, when the FBI pointed
out that such information

1498
01:20:08,389 --> 01:20:09,723
wouldn't be admissible in court,

1499
01:20:09,807 --> 01:20:13,936
Pash made it clear he had no intention
of leaving any witness left to prosecute.

1500
01:20:14,019 --> 01:20:17,106
Now, the FBI talked him down, but
that's the man you're dancing with.

1501
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:19,900
I gather you've heard
there are other parties

1502
01:20:19,984 --> 01:20:21,986
interested in the work
of the Radiation Lab?

1503
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:29,451
A man attached to the Soviet Consul
indicated through intermediate people

1504
01:20:30,035 --> 01:20:34,581
to people on this project that he was
in a position to transmit information.

1505
01:20:34,665 --> 01:20:37,042
Why would anyone on
the project wanna do that?

1506
01:20:38,961 --> 01:20:41,296
Frankly, I can see that
there might be an argument

1507
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:43,757
for the commander-in-chief
informing the Russians.

1508
01:20:43,841 --> 01:20:45,843
They're our allies after all.

1509
01:20:45,926 --> 01:20:48,721
But I don't like the idea of
it going out the back door.

1510
01:20:48,804 --> 01:20:51,015
It might not hurt to
be on the lookout for it.

1511
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,018
And you said that to Pash?

1512
01:20:54,101 --> 01:20:58,313
I was trying to put it in the
context of "Russia's not Germany."

1513
01:20:58,397 --> 01:21:02,901
Boris Pash is the son of a
Russian Orthodox bishop.

1514
01:21:02,985 --> 01:21:04,903
Born here, but in 1918,

1515
01:21:04,987 --> 01:21:07,406
he went back to Russia
to fight the Bolsheviks.

1516
01:21:07,489 --> 01:21:10,325
This is a man who has killed
communists with his own hands.

1517
01:21:10,409 --> 01:21:13,537
I'm not the judge of who should
or should not have information.

1518
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:16,206
It's my business to stop it
from going through illegally.

1519
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:18,167
Would you be a
little more specific?

1520
01:21:20,753 --> 01:21:24,465
There's a man whose name was
mentioned to me a couple of times.

1521
01:21:24,548 --> 01:21:25,549
Eltenton.

1522
01:21:26,675 --> 01:21:29,803
Uh, I believe he's a
chemist who works at Shell.

1523
01:21:29,887 --> 01:21:33,015
He talked to a friend of his

1524
01:21:33,098 --> 01:21:35,934
who's an acquaintance
of someone on the project.

1525
01:21:37,644 --> 01:21:40,064
And you thought Pash
would be satisfied with that?

1526
01:21:40,147 --> 01:21:43,984
I was attempting to give them
Eltenton without opening a can of worms.

1527
01:21:44,068 --> 01:21:45,944
I told them a
cock-and-bull story.

1528
01:21:46,028 --> 01:21:47,529
Did you lie to
General Groves too?

1529
01:21:47,613 --> 01:21:51,116
No. I admitted to him
that I'd lied to Pash.

1530
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,910
[attorney] Do you
recall this conversation

1531
01:21:52,993 --> 01:21:54,453
about the Chevalier incident?

1532
01:21:54,536 --> 01:21:57,498
[scoffs] I've seen so
many versions of it,

1533
01:21:57,581 --> 01:22:00,084
I wasn't confused before but
I'm certainly getting there now.

1534
01:22:00,167 --> 01:22:01,436
[attorney] What
was your conclusion?

1535
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:06,757
That he was under the influence of
the typical American schoolboy attitude

1536
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:10,302
that there's something
wicked about telling on a friend.

1537
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:11,553
Well, now...

1538
01:22:12,304 --> 01:22:14,890
Might we know through
whom the contact was made?

1539
01:22:15,474 --> 01:22:19,269
That would involve people
who are not to be involved in this.

1540
01:22:19,353 --> 01:22:22,189
Is that someone a
member of the project?

1541
01:22:22,773 --> 01:22:26,235
A member of the faculty,
yes, but not in the project, no.

1542
01:22:26,318 --> 01:22:27,319
Ah.

1543
01:22:27,861 --> 01:22:32,491
So Eltenton made his approach through
a member of the faculty here at Berkeley?

1544
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:36,870
As far as I know--
As far as I know, yes.

1545
01:22:36,954 --> 01:22:38,872
But... [stammers]...there
may have been...

1546
01:22:39,748 --> 01:22:41,458
more than one person involved.

1547
01:22:46,505 --> 01:22:50,425
Gentlemen, if I-- If I seem
uncooperative, I think you can understand

1548
01:22:50,509 --> 01:22:51,669
it's because of my insistence

1549
01:22:51,718 --> 01:22:54,596
in not getting innocent
people into trouble.

1550
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,516
You're trying to protect your
friend. Who's protecting you?

1551
01:22:57,599 --> 01:23:00,185
- Well, you could.
- If you gave me the name.

1552
01:23:00,269 --> 01:23:01,854
If you order me to, I'll do it.

1553
01:23:01,937 --> 01:23:05,023
That is a mistake, Robert.
You need to volunteer this name.

1554
01:23:06,608 --> 01:23:08,902
- [Robb] And did he give you the name?
- [Groves] He did.

1555
01:23:08,986 --> 01:23:10,338
- [Robb] But not then, did he?
- No.

1556
01:23:10,362 --> 01:23:12,865
No. In fact, it was some
months later, wasn't it?

1557
01:23:12,948 --> 01:23:13,949
It was.

1558
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:16,827
- You see me as persistent.
- Well, you are--

1559
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:18,871
You are persistent,
but that is your job.

1560
01:23:18,954 --> 01:23:22,499
And-And my job is to protect
the people that work for me.

1561
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:26,336
Instead of us going on certain steps,
which may come to your attention...

1562
01:23:28,005 --> 01:23:29,923
and be disturbing to you,

1563
01:23:30,007 --> 01:23:32,259
I would like to discuss
those with you first.

1564
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:36,680
I'm not formulating a plan. I'll
just have to digest the whole thing.

1565
01:23:41,018 --> 01:23:44,104
In the months in between your
interview with Dr. Oppenheimer

1566
01:23:44,188 --> 01:23:46,773
and his eventual
naming of Chevalier,

1567
01:23:46,857 --> 01:23:49,776
did you expend resources trying to
find the name of the intermediary?

1568
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:52,237
Considerable resources, yes.

1569
01:23:52,321 --> 01:23:54,364
Without the name, our
job was extremely difficult.

1570
01:23:54,448 --> 01:23:55,824
And when did you
receive the name?

1571
01:23:55,908 --> 01:23:58,785
I was gone by the time
Oppenheimer finally offered it up.

1572
01:23:58,869 --> 01:23:59,745
Gone?

1573
01:23:59,828 --> 01:24:01,955
They felt my time would
be better spent in Europe

1574
01:24:02,039 --> 01:24:04,374
determining the status
of the Nazi bomb project.

1575
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:05,626
Who did?

1576
01:24:06,877 --> 01:24:07,920
General Groves.

1577
01:24:08,879 --> 01:24:10,339
He transferred me to London.

1578
01:24:13,258 --> 01:24:14,259
[marbles clattering]

1579
01:24:17,179 --> 01:24:19,073
[Serber] It's a little early
for a Christmas party.

1580
01:24:19,097 --> 01:24:22,267
Something's up.
Tolman's been away.

1581
01:24:23,352 --> 01:24:24,353
Where?

1582
01:24:24,853 --> 01:24:26,021
Ruth won't tell.

1583
01:24:29,024 --> 01:24:30,901
[chattering]

1584
01:24:30,984 --> 01:24:31,985
Hey!

1585
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:39,368
Come on, Ruthie. Can't
tell me, who can you tell?

1586
01:24:39,952 --> 01:24:41,411
Compartmentalization, Oppie.

1587
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,665
What makes you think I
know where he is anyway?

1588
01:24:44,748 --> 01:24:46,500
'Cause you do a pretty
good job of knowing

1589
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:48,418
where Mr. Tolman
is when it counts.

1590
01:24:49,086 --> 01:24:50,087
Like now?

1591
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:53,507
[Groves] Attention!

1592
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:55,050
[chattering stops]

1593
01:24:56,343 --> 01:24:58,387
[Groves] Early Christmas
present for you all.

1594
01:24:59,304 --> 01:25:01,098
[scattered laughter]

1595
01:25:02,891 --> 01:25:05,102
[cheering]

1596
01:25:06,812 --> 01:25:09,147
[Bohr] The British pilots
put me in the bomb bay.

1597
01:25:09,231 --> 01:25:12,234
Showed me the-the oxygen,
you know, but I messed it up.

1598
01:25:12,317 --> 01:25:13,318
[scattered laughter]

1599
01:25:13,402 --> 01:25:15,696
When they opened me up in
Scotland, I was unconscious.

1600
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:18,740
- But I pretended I'd been napping.
- [laughing]

1601
01:25:18,824 --> 01:25:20,242
[Bohr] Please enjoy your party.

1602
01:25:21,451 --> 01:25:22,786
Is it big enough?

1603
01:25:22,869 --> 01:25:24,246
To end the war?

1604
01:25:24,913 --> 01:25:27,040
To end all war.

1605
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:33,964
- Heisenberg sought me out in Copenhagen.
- [marbles clattering]

1606
01:25:34,715 --> 01:25:37,968
It was chilling, my old
student working for the Nazis.

1607
01:25:38,051 --> 01:25:41,763
He told me some
things to draw me out.

1608
01:25:42,723 --> 01:25:45,684
Sustained fission
reactions in uranium.

1609
01:25:45,767 --> 01:25:47,853
That sounds more like
a reactor than a bomb.

1610
01:25:47,936 --> 01:25:49,688
Did he mention
gaseous diffusion?

1611
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:51,982
He seemed more
focused on heavy water.

1612
01:25:52,065 --> 01:25:53,817
As a moderator?

1613
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,152
Yes, instead of graphite.

1614
01:25:55,235 --> 01:25:57,112
[Bethe laughs]

1615
01:25:58,238 --> 01:25:59,531
What?

1616
01:26:00,615 --> 01:26:03,368
He took a wrong
turn. We're ahead.

1617
01:26:03,452 --> 01:26:05,370
And with you here
to help us, Niels...

1618
01:26:05,454 --> 01:26:09,124
Sorry, could you-- could you
give us a moment, gentlemen?

1619
01:26:09,207 --> 01:26:10,292
[glasses clinking]

1620
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:17,924
I am not here to help, Robert.

1621
01:26:18,425 --> 01:26:20,635
I knew you could
do this without me.

1622
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:22,846
- Then why did you come?
- To talk about after.

1623
01:26:22,929 --> 01:26:27,351
The power you're about to
reveal will forever outlive the Nazis.

1624
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:29,686
And the world is not prepared.

1625
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:33,315
"You could lift the stone without being
ready for the snake that's revealed."

1626
01:26:33,398 --> 01:26:35,233
We have to make the
politicians understand,

1627
01:26:35,317 --> 01:26:36,860
this isn't a new weapon.

1628
01:26:37,486 --> 01:26:38,612
It's a new world.

1629
01:26:39,363 --> 01:26:41,782
I'll be out there doing
what I can, but you...

1630
01:26:42,366 --> 01:26:45,160
You are an American Prometheus.

1631
01:26:45,243 --> 01:26:49,122
The man who gave them the
power to destroy themselves,

1632
01:26:49,206 --> 01:26:50,957
and they'll respect that.

1633
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:53,043
Then your work really begins.

1634
01:26:57,672 --> 01:27:00,050
I'm sorry, Oppie,
but there's a call.

1635
01:27:01,843 --> 01:27:03,178
From San Francisco.

1636
01:27:10,268 --> 01:27:11,353
Robert?

1637
01:27:15,857 --> 01:27:16,983
Robert?

1638
01:27:17,484 --> 01:27:20,112
Robert. Robert.

1639
01:27:20,195 --> 01:27:21,696
Oh, my God. What's the matter?

1640
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:22,948
What happened?

1641
01:27:23,031 --> 01:27:24,408
[both breathing heavily]

1642
01:27:24,491 --> 01:27:26,368
Her father called.

1643
01:27:26,451 --> 01:27:28,078
They found her
yesterday in the bath.

1644
01:27:29,913 --> 01:27:30,997
Who?

1645
01:27:32,457 --> 01:27:34,042
She'd taken pills.

1646
01:27:34,126 --> 01:27:35,460
Left a note, not signed.

1647
01:27:37,003 --> 01:27:39,881
She took barbiturates, but there
was chloral hydrate in her blood.

1648
01:27:39,965 --> 01:27:41,466
[gasping]

1649
01:27:43,468 --> 01:27:44,678
There was a note.

1650
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:46,888
Jean Tatlock?

1651
01:27:53,603 --> 01:27:54,855
We were together.

1652
01:27:55,522 --> 01:27:57,315
She said she needed me. I...

1653
01:27:59,693 --> 01:28:01,820
I told her I... [breathing
shakily] ...I wouldn't--

1654
01:28:02,696 --> 01:28:04,406
I told her I couldn't--

1655
01:28:04,489 --> 01:28:06,491
No, it was-- it was me--

1656
01:28:07,951 --> 01:28:11,329
[breathing heavily] You
don't get to commit the sin

1657
01:28:11,413 --> 01:28:14,791
and then have us all feel sorry
for you that it had consequences.

1658
01:28:18,128 --> 01:28:20,005
You pull yourself together.

1659
01:28:24,009 --> 01:28:25,927
You know, people
here depend on you.

1660
01:28:28,138 --> 01:28:30,324
[Serber] Donald, would you
like to contribute here, please?

1661
01:28:30,348 --> 01:28:31,576
[Donald] You're
on your own, pal.

1662
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,519
Bob, I'm not quitting my job
because plutonium is radioactive.

1663
01:28:34,603 --> 01:28:37,522
We just don't know what it might do
to the female reproductive system--

1664
01:28:37,606 --> 01:28:40,692
Your reproductive system is more
exposed than mine, presumably.

1665
01:28:40,775 --> 01:28:43,445
Can we please? The
implosion device is nowhere.

1666
01:28:43,528 --> 01:28:45,128
You can't rush
everything. Oppie, please.

1667
01:28:45,155 --> 01:28:47,795
Well, there's rushing and there's
getting on with it, so, pick one.

1668
01:28:47,866 --> 01:28:49,743
Wait. Neddermeyer's
doing his job.

1669
01:28:49,826 --> 01:28:52,454
Teller's not helping.
You're not helping.

1670
01:28:52,537 --> 01:28:55,141
I've been asking for calculations
on the implosion lenses for weeks.

1671
01:28:55,165 --> 01:28:57,792
- The British can do it. Fuchs.
- Absolutely.

1672
01:28:57,876 --> 01:29:01,171
- It's your job, Teller.
- I'm engaged in research.

1673
01:29:01,254 --> 01:29:03,673
On a hydrogen bomb
we're not even building.

1674
01:29:03,757 --> 01:29:05,383
[scattered laughter]

1675
01:29:11,932 --> 01:29:13,141
I won't work for that man.

1676
01:29:13,225 --> 01:29:15,018
[jeering]

1677
01:29:15,101 --> 01:29:17,270
Let him go. He's a prima donna.

1678
01:29:17,354 --> 01:29:19,314
[Serber] I agree. He
should leave Los Alamos.

1679
01:29:19,397 --> 01:29:20,899
Okay.

1680
01:29:20,982 --> 01:29:24,194
Kisty, you replace Neddermeyer.
Seth, I'm putting you on plutonium.

1681
01:29:24,277 --> 01:29:27,781
Lilli, you go work for Kisty,
because he needs you.

1682
01:29:27,864 --> 01:29:29,533
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.

1683
01:29:29,616 --> 01:29:32,410
I'm putting you exclusively
on the implosion device.

1684
01:29:32,494 --> 01:29:36,122
And no one is
leaving Los Alamos.

1685
01:29:37,707 --> 01:29:39,709
[vehicle engine starting]

1686
01:29:39,793 --> 01:29:41,795
[chattering on loudspeaker]

1687
01:29:50,512 --> 01:29:51,763
They won't let me leave.

1688
01:29:51,846 --> 01:29:53,807
No. I won't let you leave.

1689
01:29:55,517 --> 01:29:58,103
Forget Hans. Forget fission.

1690
01:29:58,186 --> 01:30:01,314
Stay here, research
what you want.

1691
01:30:01,398 --> 01:30:03,733
Fusion, the hydrogen
bomb, whatever.

1692
01:30:03,817 --> 01:30:05,110
We'll meet to discuss.

1693
01:30:05,193 --> 01:30:08,029
You don't have time to meet.
You're a politician now, Robert.

1694
01:30:08,113 --> 01:30:10,657
You've left physics behind
many, many years ago.

1695
01:30:11,825 --> 01:30:12,826
Once a week.

1696
01:30:13,493 --> 01:30:15,245
One hour, you and me.

1697
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:22,836
Now raise this fucking barrier.

1698
01:30:27,841 --> 01:30:31,511
[Robb] So the Super was under
development on your watch at Los Alamos?

1699
01:30:31,595 --> 01:30:33,013
Yes.

1700
01:30:33,096 --> 01:30:36,558
And yet, after the war, you
tried to deny it was viable.

1701
01:30:36,641 --> 01:30:39,728
No, no, no. I-I pointed out
technical difficulties with it.

1702
01:30:39,811 --> 01:30:41,771
Didn't you try to kill
it at the AEC meeting

1703
01:30:41,855 --> 01:30:43,273
- after the Russian bomb test?
- No.

1704
01:30:43,356 --> 01:30:46,610
[Robb] But that was the
recommendation of the AEC, was it not?

1705
01:30:46,693 --> 01:30:49,821
After hours of discussion
about the best response.

1706
01:30:49,904 --> 01:30:55,118
An H-bomb is 1,000 times
the power of an A-bomb.

1707
01:30:55,869 --> 01:30:59,998
Its only intended target
would be the largest cities.

1708
01:31:00,081 --> 01:31:01,625
It's a weapon of mass genocide.

1709
01:31:01,708 --> 01:31:05,920
Izzy, draw some circles on this side
of the map where they would target us.

1710
01:31:06,004 --> 01:31:07,130
Starting with New York.

1711
01:31:07,213 --> 01:31:08,399
- [Rabi] That's fair.
- [Strauss] DC.

1712
01:31:08,423 --> 01:31:11,051
It's a weapon of attack
with no defensive value.

1713
01:31:11,134 --> 01:31:12,636
- Deterrence.
- [Bush] "Deterrence"?

1714
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:16,806
Do we really need more deterrence
than our current arsenal of atomic bombs?

1715
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:20,935
Y-You drown in ten feet of water
or 10,000, what's the difference?

1716
01:31:21,019 --> 01:31:23,146
We can already drown
Russia. They know it.

1717
01:31:23,229 --> 01:31:25,523
- Now they can drown us.
- [Rabi] We're just escalating.

1718
01:31:29,486 --> 01:31:32,364
- [feet stamping]
- [Strauss, distant] Robert? Robert.

1719
01:31:32,447 --> 01:31:34,532
- [stamping stops]
- [teaspoon clinks]

1720
01:31:36,368 --> 01:31:37,369
As I said,

1721
01:31:37,452 --> 01:31:41,289
Teller's designs are still as
impractical as they were during the war.

1722
01:31:41,373 --> 01:31:44,209
A hydrogen bomb can be made
to work, Oppie, you know that.

1723
01:31:44,292 --> 01:31:47,087
I don't believe we should commit
all our resources to that chance.

1724
01:31:47,170 --> 01:31:50,173
Then how would you have Truman
reassure the American people?

1725
01:31:50,256 --> 01:31:52,592
Simply by limiting the
spread of atomic weapons

1726
01:31:52,676 --> 01:31:55,136
through international
control on nuclear energy.

1727
01:31:55,762 --> 01:31:57,472
By which you mean
world government.

1728
01:31:57,555 --> 01:32:00,392
The United Nations,
as Roosevelt intended.

1729
01:32:00,475 --> 01:32:03,353
Well, I asked what
Truman should do, right?

1730
01:32:03,436 --> 01:32:04,437
The world's changed.

1731
01:32:04,521 --> 01:32:07,899
It's not fascism but communism
that now threatens our survival.

1732
01:32:07,982 --> 01:32:09,859
Lewis, do you understand,

1733
01:32:09,943 --> 01:32:11,528
if we build a hydrogen bomb,

1734
01:32:11,611 --> 01:32:13,822
the Russians will have no
choice but to build their own?

1735
01:32:13,905 --> 01:32:15,448
Could they be
working on one already,

1736
01:32:15,532 --> 01:32:18,535
based on information gathered
from a spy at Los Alamos?

1737
01:32:18,618 --> 01:32:20,078
No spy at Los Alamos.

1738
01:32:20,161 --> 01:32:22,997
- Gentlemen. Let's not get sidetracked.
- There wasn't?

1739
01:32:23,081 --> 01:32:25,750
I say we use this moment to gain
concessions from the Russians

1740
01:32:25,834 --> 01:32:28,795
by committing that we will
not build a hydrogen bomb.

1741
01:32:28,878 --> 01:32:30,547
Thereby revealing its existence.

1742
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:32,632
Which you seem
convinced they already know.

1743
01:32:32,716 --> 01:32:36,136
[clears throat] All right. At this
point, I'd like the committee members

1744
01:32:36,219 --> 01:32:39,889
to meet in privacy to
finalize our recommendations.

1745
01:32:41,433 --> 01:32:43,393
I'm just not sure you
wanna go down this road.

1746
01:32:43,476 --> 01:32:44,477
Lewis, with respect,

1747
01:32:44,561 --> 01:32:47,355
we are the advisory committee,
we will give them our advice.

1748
01:32:52,861 --> 01:32:54,112
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1749
01:32:54,195 --> 01:32:55,321
Hi.

1750
01:32:55,405 --> 01:32:58,241
William Borden. Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy?

1751
01:32:58,324 --> 01:32:59,576
Oh, yes, yes.

1752
01:32:59,659 --> 01:33:01,035
During the war, I was a pilot.

1753
01:33:02,495 --> 01:33:05,123
One night, flying
back from a raid,

1754
01:33:05,206 --> 01:33:07,000
I saw an amazing sight,

1755
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:08,752
like a meteor.

1756
01:33:08,835 --> 01:33:11,963
A V-2 rocket headed to England.

1757
01:33:12,046 --> 01:33:15,049
I can't help but imagine what it
will be for such an enemy rocket

1758
01:33:15,133 --> 01:33:17,969
to carry an atomic warhead.

1759
01:33:18,052 --> 01:33:19,763
[feet stamping]

1760
01:33:20,847 --> 01:33:21,847
[rocket rumbling]

1761
01:33:23,433 --> 01:33:25,143
[stamping intensifies, stops]

1762
01:33:26,936 --> 01:33:29,564
Well, let's make sure we're not
the ones to make that possible.

1763
01:33:35,695 --> 01:33:38,031
Oppie, I don't think you
wanna go up against Strauss.

1764
01:33:38,865 --> 01:33:41,034
If we both speak,
they listen to me.

1765
01:33:41,576 --> 01:33:43,453
When you speak,
they hear a prophet.

1766
01:33:43,536 --> 01:33:45,371
When Strauss speaks,
they hear themselves.

1767
01:33:45,455 --> 01:33:47,540
They'll listen to a prophet.

1768
01:33:47,624 --> 01:33:49,542
A prophet can't be wrong.

1769
01:33:49,626 --> 01:33:50,543
Not once.

1770
01:33:50,627 --> 01:33:54,130
[McGee] Didn't you accuse Oppenheimer
of sabotaging the development of the Super?

1771
01:33:54,214 --> 01:33:58,510
I was never one of those to
bandy around terms like "sabotage."

1772
01:33:58,593 --> 01:34:00,011
[McGee] But Mr. Borden was?

1773
01:34:00,637 --> 01:34:02,347
As I understand it, possibly.

1774
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:06,100
How was Mr. Borden able to put
together such a detailed indictment?

1775
01:34:06,184 --> 01:34:07,769
He was no longer a
government employee,

1776
01:34:07,852 --> 01:34:10,021
yet he appears to have
had unlimited access

1777
01:34:10,104 --> 01:34:11,606
to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

1778
01:34:11,689 --> 01:34:14,442
Might Mr. Nichols have
given him access to the file?

1779
01:34:14,526 --> 01:34:16,653
Or someone else at the AEC?

1780
01:34:16,736 --> 01:34:19,447
That's a very serious
accusation, Senator.

1781
01:34:19,531 --> 01:34:21,115
Is it your intention to suggest

1782
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:23,868
that Dr. Oppenheimer is
disloyal to the United States?

1783
01:34:24,452 --> 01:34:26,538
I've always assumed,
and still assume,

1784
01:34:26,621 --> 01:34:29,040
that he's loyal to
the United States.

1785
01:34:29,123 --> 01:34:30,166
I believe this.

1786
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:33,628
And I shall believe it until I see
very conclusive proof to the opposite.

1787
01:34:33,711 --> 01:34:37,715
[Robb] Do you, or do you not, believe
that Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

1788
01:34:46,599 --> 01:34:49,686
[Hornig] And if I may, when Hitler
blew his brains out in that bunker,

1789
01:34:49,769 --> 01:34:53,022
it is my humble opinion that there
is no need for that bomb to be seen

1790
01:34:53,106 --> 01:34:54,607
anywhere except
for that test site.

1791
01:34:54,691 --> 01:34:55,567
[scattered applause]

1792
01:34:55,650 --> 01:34:58,236
[Lilli] We at least have to
take a moment to think about

1793
01:34:58,319 --> 01:35:01,406
whether the means justify
the ends any longer, because--

1794
01:35:04,117 --> 01:35:06,286
Germany is about to surrender.

1795
01:35:06,369 --> 01:35:08,329
[members cheering, applauding]

1796
01:35:08,413 --> 01:35:12,417
It's no longer the enemy who
are the greatest threat to mankind.

1797
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,500
It's our work.

1798
01:35:16,087 --> 01:35:18,506
Hitler is dead, it's true.

1799
01:35:20,466 --> 01:35:22,010
But the Japanese fight on.

1800
01:35:22,093 --> 01:35:23,845
Their defeat seems assured.

1801
01:35:23,928 --> 01:35:26,556
Not if you're a GI
preparing to invade.

1802
01:35:28,099 --> 01:35:29,183
We can end this war.

1803
01:35:29,267 --> 01:35:32,604
But how do we justify using
this weapon on human beings?

1804
01:35:32,687 --> 01:35:33,897
[scattered applause]

1805
01:35:35,899 --> 01:35:38,735
We're theorists, yes?

1806
01:35:40,069 --> 01:35:44,198
We imagine a future, and
our imaginings horrify us.

1807
01:35:45,575 --> 01:35:47,911
But they won't fear it
until they understand it,

1808
01:35:47,994 --> 01:35:50,663
and they won't understand
it until they've used it.

1809
01:35:50,747 --> 01:35:54,584
When the world learns the
terrible secret of Los Alamos,

1810
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:58,087
our work here will ensure a
peace mankind has never seen.

1811
01:35:58,171 --> 01:36:01,299
A peace based on the kind
of international cooperation

1812
01:36:01,382 --> 01:36:03,509
that Roosevelt always envisaged.

1813
01:36:08,723 --> 01:36:11,559
- [Oppenheimer] Progress?
- Two years and a billion dollars' worth?

1814
01:36:12,477 --> 01:36:14,145
Well, hard to put a price on it.

1815
01:36:14,228 --> 01:36:15,897
Not really. Just
add up the bills.

1816
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:20,234
"Rural free deliveries." Eighty
babies delivered the first year.

1817
01:36:20,318 --> 01:36:22,904
This year we've had ten a month.

1818
01:36:22,987 --> 01:36:25,865
Birth control is a little out
of my jurisdiction, General.

1819
01:36:26,366 --> 01:36:27,486
- Clearly.
- [Kitty] General.

1820
01:36:27,533 --> 01:36:28,618
Kiddo.

1821
01:36:33,623 --> 01:36:36,668
Head down, every--
Fuchs. Head down.

1822
01:36:43,675 --> 01:36:45,551
That's the one. [grunts]

1823
01:36:45,635 --> 01:36:48,137
Two viable bombs. I need a date.

1824
01:36:51,182 --> 01:36:52,392
September.

1825
01:36:52,475 --> 01:36:53,518
July.

1826
01:36:53,601 --> 01:36:55,395
That's the sweet
spot, gentlemen.

1827
01:36:56,187 --> 01:36:57,730
August.

1828
01:36:57,814 --> 01:36:59,357
July.

1829
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:02,485
Test in July. But I
need my brother.

1830
01:37:06,823 --> 01:37:09,409
Frank knows the desert,
he's left politics behind,

1831
01:37:09,492 --> 01:37:11,703
he's been working with
Lawrence for two years now.

1832
01:37:18,751 --> 01:37:20,378
What do we call the test?

1833
01:37:21,921 --> 01:37:25,341
"Batter my heart,
three person'd God."

1834
01:37:25,425 --> 01:37:26,426
What?

1835
01:37:28,011 --> 01:37:29,012
Trinity.

1836
01:37:37,186 --> 01:37:39,248
[Robb] You insisted on
bringing on your brother Frank,

1837
01:37:39,272 --> 01:37:40,398
a known communist.

1838
01:37:40,481 --> 01:37:42,108
Former communist.

1839
01:37:42,191 --> 01:37:44,110
You brought a known
former communist

1840
01:37:44,193 --> 01:37:47,947
onto America's most secret
and important defense project.

1841
01:37:48,031 --> 01:37:51,284
I knew my brother could
be trusted. Absolutely.

1842
01:37:51,367 --> 01:37:54,620
And you felt your judgment was sound
on who on the team could be trusted.

1843
01:37:55,204 --> 01:37:58,416
Fuchs, head down.
Okay, everybody ready.

1844
01:38:08,134 --> 01:38:09,385
I hope you learned something.

1845
01:38:09,469 --> 01:38:11,846
Yeah, we learned we're gonna
need to be a lot further away.

1846
01:38:11,929 --> 01:38:13,306
Well, figure it out. Fast.

1847
01:38:13,389 --> 01:38:16,392
We leave for Washington in the
morning. We're gonna give them a date.

1848
01:38:20,021 --> 01:38:21,230
[elevator bell dings]

1849
01:38:21,314 --> 01:38:22,523
[chattering]

1850
01:38:22,607 --> 01:38:24,567
[phone ringing]

1851
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:25,651
[service bell dinging]

1852
01:38:31,616 --> 01:38:33,326
You're a long way
from Chicago, Leo.

1853
01:38:33,409 --> 01:38:36,329
If we don't act now, they're going
to use this thing against Japan.

1854
01:38:36,913 --> 01:38:39,832
We booked a meeting with
Truman, but somebody killed it.

1855
01:38:39,916 --> 01:38:42,251
You're meeting
the secretary of war.

1856
01:38:42,335 --> 01:38:43,878
Just because we're building it

1857
01:38:43,961 --> 01:38:45,755
doesn't mean we get
to decide how it's used.

1858
01:38:46,631 --> 01:38:48,716
History will judge us, Robert.

1859
01:38:49,592 --> 01:38:51,552
In Chicago, we put
together a petition.

1860
01:38:52,345 --> 01:38:53,888
I'm not getting into that.

1861
01:38:53,971 --> 01:38:55,556
[clipboard clatters]

1862
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:01,080
Just tell me your
concerns and I'll relay them.

1863
01:39:01,104 --> 01:39:02,146
My concerns?

1864
01:39:02,230 --> 01:39:05,608
Germany's defeated. Japan's
not going to hold out alone.

1865
01:39:05,691 --> 01:39:07,902
How could you know
that? You got us into this.

1866
01:39:07,985 --> 01:39:11,405
You and Einstein with your letter to
Roosevelt saying we could build a bomb.

1867
01:39:11,489 --> 01:39:12,406
Against Germany.

1868
01:39:12,490 --> 01:39:15,368
That's not how weapons
manufacture works, Szilard.

1869
01:39:15,451 --> 01:39:16,762
[Szilard] Oppie,
you have to help.

1870
01:39:16,786 --> 01:39:18,597
Fermi's in the meeting.
Lawrence is in the meeting.

1871
01:39:18,621 --> 01:39:21,833
They're not you. You're the
great salesman of science.

1872
01:39:21,916 --> 01:39:24,127
You can convince
anyone of anything.

1873
01:39:25,086 --> 01:39:26,087
Even yourself.

1874
01:39:26,921 --> 01:39:27,922
Excuse me.

1875
01:39:29,423 --> 01:39:32,635
The firestorm in Tokyo
killed 100,000 people.

1876
01:39:32,718 --> 01:39:34,178
Mostly civilians.

1877
01:39:35,429 --> 01:39:38,850
I worry about an America where we
do these things and no one protests.

1878
01:39:38,933 --> 01:39:42,270
Pearl Harbor and three years
of brutal conflict in the Pacific

1879
01:39:42,353 --> 01:39:44,605
bought us a lot of latitude
with the American public.

1880
01:39:45,189 --> 01:39:47,150
[Stimson] Enough to
unleash the atomic bomb?

1881
01:39:47,233 --> 01:39:50,486
[Fermi] The A-bomb might not cause
as much damage as the Tokyo bombings.

1882
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:52,029
What are we estimating?

1883
01:39:52,113 --> 01:39:56,909
In a medium-sized city,
20,000 or 30,000 dead.

1884
01:39:56,993 --> 01:39:59,036
Yes, but don't underestimate

1885
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:02,540
the psychological impact
of an atomic explosion.

1886
01:40:03,291 --> 01:40:06,419
A pillar of fire
10,000 feet tall.

1887
01:40:07,128 --> 01:40:10,214
Deadly neutron effects
for a mile. In all directions.

1888
01:40:10,298 --> 01:40:13,176
From one single device.

1889
01:40:13,259 --> 01:40:15,428
Dropped from a
barely noticed B-29,

1890
01:40:15,511 --> 01:40:20,683
the atomic bomb will be a
terrible revelation of divine power.

1891
01:40:21,309 --> 01:40:23,936
If that's true, it
would be definitive.

1892
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:26,022
World War II would be over.

1893
01:40:26,105 --> 01:40:27,648
Our boys would come home.

1894
01:40:27,732 --> 01:40:28,858
Military targets?

1895
01:40:30,193 --> 01:40:32,195
Uh... There aren't
any big enough.

1896
01:40:32,278 --> 01:40:35,198
Perhaps a vital war plant

1897
01:40:35,281 --> 01:40:37,867
with workers housed nearby?

1898
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:41,120
And we could issue a warning
to reduce civilian casualties.

1899
01:40:41,204 --> 01:40:43,122
They'd send everything
they have up against us,

1900
01:40:43,206 --> 01:40:44,874
and I'd be up in that plane.

1901
01:40:44,957 --> 01:40:48,169
But if we announce
it and it fails to go off,

1902
01:40:48,252 --> 01:40:50,838
we'd scupper any chance
of a Japanese surrender.

1903
01:40:50,922 --> 01:40:55,343
Is there no way to demonstrate a
bomb to Japan to provoke surrender?

1904
01:40:55,426 --> 01:40:59,555
We intend to demonstrate it in
the most unambiguous terms. Twice.

1905
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:01,849
Once, to show the
weapon's power,

1906
01:41:01,933 --> 01:41:05,353
and a second to show that we can
keep doing this until they surrender.

1907
01:41:05,436 --> 01:41:08,814
We have a list of 12
cities to choose from--

1908
01:41:08,898 --> 01:41:10,816
Sorry, 11.

1909
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,777
I've taken Kyoto off the list

1910
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:16,405
due to its cultural significance
to the Japanese people.

1911
01:41:16,489 --> 01:41:18,699
Also, my wife and I
honeymooned there.

1912
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,493
It's a magnificent city.

1913
01:41:24,163 --> 01:41:25,957
Let me make this
simple for you, gentlemen.

1914
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:28,501
According to my intelligence,
which I cannot share with you,

1915
01:41:28,584 --> 01:41:32,672
the Japanese people will not
surrender, under any circumstances,

1916
01:41:32,755 --> 01:41:36,050
short of a successful and total
invasion of the home islands.

1917
01:41:36,801 --> 01:41:39,387
Many lives will be lost,
American and Japanese.

1918
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:43,391
The use of the atomic bomb
on Japanese cities will save lives.

1919
01:41:43,474 --> 01:41:45,393
If we retain moral advantage.

1920
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:47,228
How so?

1921
01:41:47,311 --> 01:41:49,539
Well, if we use this weapon
without informing our allies,

1922
01:41:49,563 --> 01:41:52,441
they'll see it as a threat,
and we'll be in an arms race.

1923
01:41:52,525 --> 01:41:54,443
How open can we
be with the Soviets?

1924
01:41:54,527 --> 01:41:58,572
Secrecy won't stop the Soviets from
becoming part of the atomic world.

1925
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,658
We've been told
they have no uranium.

1926
01:42:00,741 --> 01:42:03,703
You've been misinformed. A
Russian bomb is a matter of time.

1927
01:42:03,786 --> 01:42:07,248
The program needs to
continue at full pace after the war.

1928
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,875
Secretary Stimson, if I may,

1929
01:42:09,959 --> 01:42:13,921
not all scientists on the
project are in agreement.

1930
01:42:14,005 --> 01:42:17,591
In fact, this might be a moment to
consider other opinions. If you talk--

1931
01:42:17,675 --> 01:42:20,344
The Manhattan Project has
been plagued from the start

1932
01:42:20,428 --> 01:42:23,806
by certain scientists
of doubtful discretion

1933
01:42:23,889 --> 01:42:25,308
and uncertain loyalty.

1934
01:42:25,391 --> 01:42:27,393
One of them just tried to
meet with the president.

1935
01:42:27,476 --> 01:42:30,563
Now, we need these men,
but as soon as it's practical,

1936
01:42:30,646 --> 01:42:32,940
we should sever any such
scientists from the program.

1937
01:42:33,024 --> 01:42:34,275
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

1938
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:37,540
[Marshall] If a Russian
bomb is inevitable,

1939
01:42:38,237 --> 01:42:41,282
perhaps we should invite
their top scientists to Trinity?

1940
01:42:41,365 --> 01:42:44,952
President Truman has no
intention of raising expectations

1941
01:42:45,036 --> 01:42:47,705
that Stalin be included
in the atomic project.

1942
01:42:47,788 --> 01:42:49,248
Informing him of
our breakthrough

1943
01:42:49,332 --> 01:42:51,250
and presenting it as a
means to win the war

1944
01:42:51,334 --> 01:42:53,127
need not make
unkeepable promises.

1945
01:42:53,210 --> 01:42:55,338
But the Potsdam
peace conference in July

1946
01:42:55,421 --> 01:42:58,758
will be President Truman's last
chance to have that conversation.

1947
01:42:59,467 --> 01:43:01,302
Can you give us a
working bomb by then?

1948
01:43:02,678 --> 01:43:05,890
Absolutely. We will test
fire before the conference.

1949
01:43:10,770 --> 01:43:16,984
Ground Zero, observation posts at
10,000 yards north, south and west.

1950
01:43:17,068 --> 01:43:18,069
Where do we trigger from?

1951
01:43:18,152 --> 01:43:20,237
South, 10,000.

1952
01:43:20,321 --> 01:43:23,574
And Base Camp is
ten miles south here.

1953
01:43:23,657 --> 01:43:28,913
And there's a further observation
post on-- on that hill 20 miles away.

1954
01:43:28,996 --> 01:43:31,916
What's that, Frank?
Trigger lines already went in.

1955
01:43:31,999 --> 01:43:35,461
The Air Force requested a
line of lights for their B-29.

1956
01:43:35,544 --> 01:43:37,880
What B-29? Our
bomb's on the tower.

1957
01:43:37,963 --> 01:43:41,050
They wanna use the test to
confirm a safe operating distance.

1958
01:43:41,133 --> 01:43:43,844
- That's risky.
- Not as risky as dropping one over Japan

1959
01:43:43,928 --> 01:43:45,947
and hoping that we were
right about the blast radius.

1960
01:43:45,971 --> 01:43:48,140
Don't let them slow us
down. We're firing on the 15th.

1961
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:50,518
- The 15th? That's not--
- [Groves] The 15th.

1962
01:43:52,228 --> 01:43:53,229
The 15th.

1963
01:43:54,605 --> 01:43:56,625
[Oppenheimer] So I'll be
here at South Observation point

1964
01:43:56,649 --> 01:43:58,943
with Frank and Kistiakowsky.

1965
01:43:59,026 --> 01:44:02,780
You'll all be assigned to
Base Camp, West Observation,

1966
01:44:02,863 --> 01:44:04,448
or Far Observation.

1967
01:44:14,375 --> 01:44:18,295
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Careful
with the knife. There, carefully.

1968
01:44:19,797 --> 01:44:23,843
- Are those safe distances?
- They're based on your calculations.

1969
01:44:23,926 --> 01:44:26,470
Time to stand behind your
science, Hans. Literally.

1970
01:44:50,077 --> 01:44:51,120
Yeah.

1971
01:44:56,417 --> 01:44:58,085
What about the radiation cloud?

1972
01:44:58,169 --> 01:45:01,297
Without high winds, it should
settle within two to three miles.

1973
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,591
Evacuation measures
are in place. [inhales]

1974
01:45:03,674 --> 01:45:06,469
But we need good weather
for visibility, so it has to be fine.

1975
01:45:07,928 --> 01:45:09,263
Everybody out.

1976
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,400
We go on the night of the 15th.

1977
01:45:21,484 --> 01:45:25,446
It's a hard deadline, so if
anyone has anything, speak now.

1978
01:45:25,529 --> 01:45:27,698
Little, little more.
Okay, stop, stop.

1979
01:45:27,781 --> 01:45:31,577
Everybody, mattresses.
Put the mattress underneath.

1980
01:45:48,844 --> 01:45:51,347
Could use a final
implosion test.

1981
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:55,684
- It couldn't hurt.
- Do it.

1982
01:45:56,936 --> 01:45:59,146
Is there anything else
that might stop us?

1983
01:45:59,230 --> 01:46:00,439
[thunderclap]

1984
01:46:02,733 --> 01:46:05,110
[sheets flapping]

1985
01:46:34,014 --> 01:46:35,558
It's happening, isn't it?

1986
01:46:37,726 --> 01:46:39,144
I'll send a message.

1987
01:46:39,895 --> 01:46:41,313
If it's gone our way...

1988
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:43,983
take in the sheets.

1989
01:46:48,153 --> 01:46:49,196
Robert.

1990
01:46:52,408 --> 01:46:53,450
Break a leg.

1991
01:47:06,797 --> 01:47:07,798
Okay.

1992
01:47:59,933 --> 01:48:03,103
[Fermi] Oppie's taken a
very modest three kilotons.

1993
01:48:03,187 --> 01:48:05,439
- Teller's in with 45.
- [Rabi] Twenty.

1994
01:48:05,522 --> 01:48:07,775
20,000 tons of TNT.

1995
01:48:07,858 --> 01:48:11,153
And does anyone want the side
action on atmospheric ignition?

1996
01:48:11,236 --> 01:48:13,113
[laughter]

1997
01:48:13,906 --> 01:48:17,076
- Are you saying we'll have to delay?
- I'm saying it would be prudent.

1998
01:48:17,159 --> 01:48:18,952
This weather, has
it reached the site?

1999
01:48:22,831 --> 01:48:23,999
[phone ringing]

2000
01:48:24,083 --> 01:48:26,251
Bethe is calling to tell you
the implosion test failed.

2001
01:48:26,335 --> 01:48:28,879
Hello, Hans. Yes, he's here.

2002
01:48:30,172 --> 01:48:31,173
Yes.

2003
01:48:32,591 --> 01:48:33,652
[handset settles in cradle]

2004
01:48:33,676 --> 01:48:35,302
- Is he wrong?
- No.

2005
01:48:35,386 --> 01:48:37,137
- No?
- No.

2006
01:48:38,138 --> 01:48:40,599
- So we're about to fire a dud?
- No.

2007
01:48:40,683 --> 01:48:44,061
- Explain.
- Well, I can't. I just-- I just know.

2008
01:48:44,144 --> 01:48:45,854
I know the implosion
lenses will work.

2009
01:48:45,938 --> 01:48:48,378
If we fire these detonators
and they don't trigger a reaction,

2010
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:52,069
two years' worth of plutonium will
be scattered across White Sands.

2011
01:48:52,152 --> 01:48:54,780
A month of my salary
against ten bucks says it lights.

2012
01:48:55,572 --> 01:48:56,572
Jesus.

2013
01:49:03,789 --> 01:49:05,892
[weatherman] The wind's
picking up at Zero, not the rain.

2014
01:49:05,916 --> 01:49:07,000
Lightning circling.

2015
01:49:07,084 --> 01:49:08,877
You think it might be
time to tell your men

2016
01:49:08,961 --> 01:49:11,630
to get away from the steel
tower with the atomic bomb?

2017
01:49:11,714 --> 01:49:14,842
[laughter]

2018
01:49:14,925 --> 01:49:17,553
- Let's get to South Observation.
- Pull 'em out.

2019
01:49:17,636 --> 01:49:19,722
[Oppenheimer] We can
make our determination there.

2020
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:22,850
[thunderclap]

2021
01:49:24,893 --> 01:49:27,020
[Oppenheimer] The team
hasn't slept in two nights.

2022
01:49:27,104 --> 01:49:30,441
If we stand down, make the bomb
safe, we won't be back here for weeks.

2023
01:49:30,524 --> 01:49:34,236
Then we'll miss Potsdam. I
gotta get word to Truman by 7:00.

2024
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:36,280
Our window's closing.
What is this doing?

2025
01:49:36,363 --> 01:49:37,740
Raining, blowing, lightning.

2026
01:49:37,823 --> 01:49:39,992
- For how long, damn it?
- It's holdin' strong.

2027
01:49:40,075 --> 01:49:42,244
- It'll break before dawn.
- How could you know that?

2028
01:49:42,327 --> 01:49:44,329
I know this desert.
Storm cools overnight.

2029
01:49:44,413 --> 01:49:46,457
Just before dawn,
the storm breaks.

2030
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:48,709
He could be right, but
schedule as late as possible.

2031
01:49:48,792 --> 01:49:50,043
5:30.

2032
01:49:50,127 --> 01:49:52,463
Sign your forecast. If
you're wrong, I'll hang you.

2033
01:49:52,546 --> 01:49:54,757
- Frank, tell them all, 5:30.
- 5:30.

2034
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,008
- 5:30.
- 5:30.

2035
01:49:58,677 --> 01:50:00,387
Three years,

2036
01:50:00,471 --> 01:50:01,805
4,000 people,

2037
01:50:01,889 --> 01:50:03,599
two billion dollars.

2038
01:50:03,682 --> 01:50:05,976
Well, if it doesn't go off,

2039
01:50:06,059 --> 01:50:07,352
we're both finished.

2040
01:50:08,228 --> 01:50:10,189
[thunder rumbling]

2041
01:50:10,272 --> 01:50:12,900
I'm betting on three kilotons.

2042
01:50:12,983 --> 01:50:14,818
Anything less, they
won't get what it is.

2043
01:50:15,819 --> 01:50:19,156
What did Fermi mean
by "atmospheric ignition"?

2044
01:50:19,239 --> 01:50:20,282
Well, we had a moment

2045
01:50:20,365 --> 01:50:24,453
where it looked like the chain reaction
from an atomic device might never stop.

2046
01:50:25,287 --> 01:50:27,372
Setting fire to the atmosphere.

2047
01:50:27,456 --> 01:50:29,917
Why is Fermi still
taking side bets on it?

2048
01:50:30,626 --> 01:50:32,586
Call it gallows humor.

2049
01:50:35,422 --> 01:50:40,052
Wait, are we saying there's a
chance that when we push that button,

2050
01:50:40,135 --> 01:50:41,470
we destroy the world?

2051
01:50:41,553 --> 01:50:45,265
Nothing in our research over
three years supports that conclusion.

2052
01:50:45,349 --> 01:50:48,101
Except as the most
remote possibility.

2053
01:50:49,061 --> 01:50:51,021
- How remote?
- Chances are near zero.

2054
01:50:52,606 --> 01:50:53,607
Near zero.

2055
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:57,236
What do you want
from theory alone?

2056
01:50:57,319 --> 01:50:58,320
[scoffs]

2057
01:50:59,071 --> 01:51:00,948
Zero would be nice.

2058
01:51:04,368 --> 01:51:10,332
In exactly one hour,
58 minutes, we'll know.

2059
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:18,257
It's letting up.

2060
01:51:31,228 --> 01:51:33,480
The arming party's left
Zero, they're heading this way.

2061
01:51:33,564 --> 01:51:34,564
Throwing the switches.

2062
01:51:34,606 --> 01:51:37,860
Turn the cars. Ready
for emergency evacuation.

Everybody, take your places.

2066
01:51:59,172 --> 01:52:01,008
Everybody take a welder's glass!

2067
01:52:02,759 --> 01:52:04,595
Everybody take a welder's glass.

[timer ticking]

2069
01:52:56,271 --> 01:52:57,481
Twenty minutes.

2070

[Fermi] Twenty minutes.

2071
01:53:13,789 --> 01:53:15,123
[Feynman] That's 20.

2072
01:53:18,335 --> 01:53:19,711
On the leg, please.

2073
01:53:21,296 --> 01:53:23,131
- Feynman.
- No.

2074
01:53:23,215 --> 01:53:25,884
- For your eyes, sir.
- The glass stops the UV.

2075
01:53:25,968 --> 01:53:27,511
And what stops the glass?

2076
01:53:29,262 --> 01:53:31,765
I'm gonna head to
Base Camp. Best of luck.

2077
01:53:32,474 --> 01:53:33,934
Robert...

2078
01:53:35,143 --> 01:53:36,603
try not to blow up the world.

2079
01:53:48,490 --> 01:53:49,658
Watch that needle.

2080
01:53:49,741 --> 01:53:53,203
If the detonators don't charge, or
the voltage drops below one volt,

2081
01:53:53,286 --> 01:53:54,788
you hit that button, you abort.

2083
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:57,708

[soldier on loudspeaker]
Two minutes to detonation.

Everybody down.

2086

Do not turn around until you
see light reflected on the hills.

2087
01:54:13,682 --> 01:54:16,601
Then look at the explosion
only through your welder's glass.

01:54:25,902 --> 01:54:26,903
Yeah.

[on radio] Sixty

With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer,

we'll take it from here.

Did Truman brief
Stalin at Potsdam?

2155

A brief would be
an overstatement.

He referred to a
powerful new weapon.

2157

Stalin hoped we'd
use it against Japan.

That's it?

Well, it's up to the

Well, you'll keep me informed.

02:01:19,149 --> 02:01:20,150
Of course.

seen Szilard's petition?

know about the Japanese?

Edward,

2177
02:02:01,483 --> 02:02:03,359
the fact that we built this bomb

2178
02:02:03,443 --> 02:02:06,070
does not give us any
more right or responsibility

2179
02:02:06,154 --> 02:02:08,364
to decide how it's
used than anyone else.

2180
02:02:08,448 --> 02:02:10,492
But we're the only
people who know about it.

2181
02:02:11,075 --> 02:02:14,037
I've told Stimson the various
opinions of the community.

2182
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:15,205
But what's your opinion?

2183
02:02:16,831 --> 02:02:18,041
Once it's used...

2184

nuclear war, perhaps all war...

2185

builds a bigger bomb.

2187
02:02:49,614 --> 02:02:51,199
I thought they would call.

2188
02:02:51,282 --> 02:02:52,742
It's only the 5th.

2189
02:02:55,245 --> 02:02:56,913
In Japan, it's the 6th.

2190
02:03:09,968 --> 02:03:10,969
Charlotte.

2191
02:03:13,596 --> 02:03:15,056
Try Groves.

2192
02:03:16,099 --> 02:03:17,100
Anything?

2193
02:03:19,227 --> 02:03:20,770
Charlotte?

2194
02:03:20,853 --> 02:03:22,213
[Charlotte] Truman's
on the radio.

2195
02:03:23,356 --> 02:03:25,275
[Truman on radio]
Sixteen hours ago,

2196
02:03:26,192 --> 02:03:31,322
an American airplane dropped
one bomb on Hiroshima...

2197
02:03:31,406 --> 02:03:32,907
[feedback squealing]

2198
02:03:32,991 --> 02:03:36,119
[on loudspeaker]... and destroyed
its usefulness to the enemy.

2199
02:03:36,202 --> 02:03:38,204
[soldiers cheering]

2200
02:03:38,288 --> 02:03:44,002
The bomb had more power
than 20, 000 tons of TNT.

2201
02:03:46,254 --> 02:03:48,172
It is an atomic bomb.

2202
02:03:48,256 --> 02:03:50,925
- [truck horns honking]
- [soldiers cheering]

2203
02:03:51,009 --> 02:03:55,638
It is a harnessing of the
basic power of the universe.

2204
02:03:57,849 --> 02:03:58,889
[Charlotte] Groves on one.

2205
02:03:58,933 --> 02:04:00,893
[Truman] We are now
prepared to destroy,

2206
02:04:00,977 --> 02:04:04,439
more rapidly and
completely, the Japanese--

2207
02:04:04,522 --> 02:04:06,274
[clears throat] General?

2208
02:04:06,357 --> 02:04:09,152
[Groves] I'm very proud of
you and all of your people.

2209
02:04:09,235 --> 02:04:10,737
It went all right?

2210
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:13,114
Apparently, it went
with a tremendous bang.

2211
02:04:14,365 --> 02:04:18,161
Well, everyone here is feeling
reasonably good about it.

2212
02:04:20,079 --> 02:04:21,539
It's been a long road.

2213
02:04:21,623 --> 02:04:24,208
I think one of the
wisest things I ever did

2214
02:04:24,292 --> 02:04:26,544
was when I selected the
director of Los Alamos.

- [horn honking]
- [cheering]

2216
02:04:29,756 --> 02:04:33,760
[Truman] We have spent
more than two billion dollars

2217
02:04:33,843 --> 02:04:37,555
on the greatest scientific
gamble in history,

2218
02:04:38,222 --> 02:04:40,099
and we have won.

It's too soon to--

2236
02:06:34,130 --> 02:06:37,884
It's too soon to determine what
the results of the bombing are.

2237
02:06:40,970 --> 02:06:42,764
But I'll bet the
Japanese didn't like it.

Nice picture.

President Truman
will see you now.

Dr. Oppenheimer. It's an honor.

02:09:33,893 --> 02:09:35,770
- Mr. President.
- Please.

2262
02:09:35,853 --> 02:09:37,021
Thank you.

Secretary Byrnes.

2264
02:09:41,442 --> 02:09:44,153
How's it feel to be the most
famous man in the world?

2265
02:09:45,279 --> 02:09:47,949
You helped save a
lot of American lives.

2266
02:09:48,616 --> 02:09:52,912
- What we did at Hiroshima was a--
- And Nagasaki.

2267
02:09:53,746 --> 02:09:54,997
Well, obviously.

2268
02:09:55,873 --> 02:09:58,960
Your invention let us
bring our boys home.

2269
02:09:59,043 --> 02:10:01,170
Well, it was hardly...

2270
02:10:01,253 --> 02:10:02,254
my invention.

2271
02:10:02,338 --> 02:10:04,465
It was you on the cover of Time.

2272
02:10:04,548 --> 02:10:07,510
[Truman, Byrnes laughing]

2273
02:10:07,593 --> 02:10:11,263
Jim tells me you're concerned
about an arms race with the Soviets.

2274
02:10:11,347 --> 02:10:12,348
Oh, yes, uh...

2275
02:10:13,933 --> 02:10:15,226
Well, um...

2276
02:10:15,309 --> 02:10:16,644
It's that, uh,

2277
02:10:16,727 --> 02:10:19,814
now is our chance to secure...

2278
02:10:20,731 --> 02:10:23,567
international cooperation on...
[clears throat]...atomic energy

2279
02:10:23,651 --> 02:10:25,820
a-a-and I'm concerned--

2280
02:10:25,903 --> 02:10:28,781
Do you know when the Soviets
are gonna have the bomb?

2281
02:10:28,864 --> 02:10:30,700
I don't think I could
give a precise--

2282
02:10:30,783 --> 02:10:32,034
Never.

2283
02:10:32,868 --> 02:10:34,412
Never.

2284
02:10:34,495 --> 02:10:37,790
Mr. President, the Russians
have good physicists

2285
02:10:37,873 --> 02:10:40,418
- a-a-and abundant resources.
- Abundant?

2286
02:10:40,501 --> 02:10:41,502
- [Truman chuckles]
- Yes.

2287
02:10:42,253 --> 02:10:44,296
- I don't think so.
- [chuckles]

2288
02:10:44,380 --> 02:10:47,925
Well, they'll put
everything they have in...

2289
02:10:51,762 --> 02:10:56,517
I hear you're leaving
Los Alamos. [sniffles]

2290
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:57,852
What should we do with it?

2291
02:10:57,935 --> 02:11:00,062
Give it back to the Indians.

2292
02:11:07,737 --> 02:11:10,990
Um, Dr. Oppenheimer,

2293
02:11:11,073 --> 02:11:14,201
if what you say about
the Soviets is true,

2294
02:11:14,285 --> 02:11:18,372
we have to build up Los
Alamos, not shut it down.

2295
02:11:22,084 --> 02:11:23,669
Mr. President...

2296
02:11:24,879 --> 02:11:26,005
Um...

2297
02:11:29,091 --> 02:11:32,803
I feel that I have
blood on my hands.

2298
02:11:52,531 --> 02:11:57,787
You think anyone in
Hiroshima or Nagasaki

2299
02:11:57,870 --> 02:12:00,790
gives a shit who built the bomb?

2300
02:12:04,126 --> 02:12:06,504
They care who dropped it.

2301
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:08,297
I did.

2302
02:12:11,217 --> 02:12:13,677
Hiroshima isn't about you.

2303
02:12:20,142 --> 02:12:21,435
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2304
02:12:25,231 --> 02:12:26,232
[clears throat]

2305
02:12:33,072 --> 02:12:35,282
Don't let that
crybaby back in here.

2306
02:12:40,913 --> 02:12:43,958
[Strauss] Robert saw that
hand-wringing got him nowhere.

2307
02:12:44,792 --> 02:12:46,127
By the time I met him,

2308
02:12:46,210 --> 02:12:49,839
he'd fully embraced his
"father of the bomb" reputation.

2309
02:12:49,922 --> 02:12:52,258
And he used his profile
to influence policy.

2310
02:12:52,341 --> 02:12:53,926
[chattering]

2311
02:12:59,306 --> 02:13:00,307
[camera shutter clicks]

2312
02:13:01,183 --> 02:13:03,185
[Robb] Doctor, in the
years following the war,

2313
02:13:03,269 --> 02:13:05,354
would you say that you
exerted a great influence

2314
02:13:05,437 --> 02:13:07,314
on the atomic
policies of the USA?

2315
02:13:07,398 --> 02:13:09,942
[Oppenheimer] I think "great"
would be an overstatement.

2316
02:13:10,025 --> 02:13:11,920
[Robb] Really? If we look
at the issue of isotopes,

2317
02:13:11,944 --> 02:13:15,573
were you not personally responsible for
destroying all opposition to their export?

2318
02:13:15,656 --> 02:13:18,075
- You could use a bottle of beer...
- [gallery laughing]

2319
02:13:18,159 --> 02:13:19,359
...when making atomic weapons.

2320
02:13:19,410 --> 02:13:20,411
In fact, you do.

2321
02:13:20,494 --> 02:13:21,871
I was the spokesman,

2322
02:13:21,954 --> 02:13:24,456
but the opinion among
scientists was unanimous.

2323
02:13:24,540 --> 02:13:27,626
All along with McCarthy on the
rise, he knew he was vulnerable.

2324
02:13:28,502 --> 02:13:32,173
His brother was blacklisted by
every university in the country.

2325
02:13:33,674 --> 02:13:36,802
Lomanitz wound up working
the railroad, laying track.

2326
02:13:38,512 --> 02:13:40,764
And Chevalier went into exile.

2327
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:46,478
But none of that stopped
Robert from pushing the GAC

2328
02:13:46,562 --> 02:13:48,981
to recommend arms control
instead of the H-bomb.

2329
02:13:51,317 --> 02:13:54,570
He was devastated when Truman
rejected their recommendation.

2330
02:13:56,697 --> 02:13:58,365
I miss Richard
more than I can bear.

2331
02:13:58,449 --> 02:14:00,451
I know, Ruth, I know.

2332
02:14:00,534 --> 02:14:03,621
Part of me's glad he didn't live
to see where this is all going.

2333
02:14:06,874 --> 02:14:08,792
Here comes the birthday boy.

2334
02:14:08,876 --> 02:14:10,002
To gloat.

2335
02:14:10,085 --> 02:14:11,795
Have fun.

2336
02:14:11,879 --> 02:14:13,839
Robert, uh, my
son and his fiancée

2337
02:14:13,923 --> 02:14:16,318
are desperate to meet the father
of the atomic bomb, and so...

2338
02:14:16,342 --> 02:14:18,427
Well... good day.

2339
02:14:25,476 --> 02:14:26,769
Is this a bad time?

2340
02:14:27,436 --> 02:14:28,646
What do you think, Lewis?

2341
02:14:29,230 --> 02:14:31,357
Well, I think it must
have been a blow for you.

2342
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:32,483
For the world.

2343
02:14:34,109 --> 02:14:37,112
The world? What does Fuchs
mean to the rest of the world?

2344
02:14:38,656 --> 02:14:40,074
Fuchs?

2345
02:14:40,157 --> 02:14:41,533
Klaus Fuchs?

2346
02:14:43,202 --> 02:14:45,412
Oh, dear. You haven't heard.

2347
02:14:48,624 --> 02:14:50,668
Klaus Fuchs, the
British scientist

2348
02:14:50,751 --> 02:14:53,295
that you put onto the
implosion team at Los Alamos...

2349
02:14:54,630 --> 02:14:59,176
turns out he was spying for
the Soviets the whole time.

2350
02:14:59,260 --> 02:15:00,469
I'm sorry.

2351
02:15:06,141 --> 02:15:08,936
[Strauss] After the truth
about Fuchs came out,

2352
02:15:09,019 --> 02:15:11,021
the FBI stepped up
surveillance on him.

2353
02:15:11,105 --> 02:15:13,691
He knew his phone was tapped,

2354
02:15:13,774 --> 02:15:15,567
he was followed everywhere,

2355
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:17,987
his trash picked through.

2356
02:15:21,198 --> 02:15:25,411
- But never stopped speaking his mind.
- A man of conviction.

2357
02:15:25,494 --> 02:15:28,414
And maybe he thought fame
could actually protect him.

2358
02:15:30,666 --> 02:15:33,544
When Eisenhower took
office, he saw one more chance.

2359
02:15:35,087 --> 02:15:36,088
He took it.

2360
02:15:36,171 --> 02:15:42,886
America and Russia may be
likened to two scorpions in a bottle,

2361
02:15:42,970 --> 02:15:49,226
each capable of killing the other,
but only at the risk of his own life.

2362
02:15:49,810 --> 02:15:51,937
Now, there are various
aspects of this policy--

2363
02:15:52,021 --> 02:15:57,026
[Strauss] Lot of scientists blame me,
but how was I supposed to protect him?

2364
02:15:57,109 --> 02:16:00,529
...are too secret for discussion,
candor is the only remedy.

2365
02:16:00,612 --> 02:16:04,199
Officials in Washington need to
start leveling with the American people.

2366
02:16:04,283 --> 02:16:05,993
[murmuring]

2367
02:16:06,076 --> 02:16:08,746
That was the last straw
for Robert's enemies.

2368
02:16:08,829 --> 02:16:10,831
So he had to lose
his security clearance?

2369
02:16:10,914 --> 02:16:13,500
- And with it, his credibility.
- [knocks on window]

2370
02:16:13,584 --> 02:16:15,836
But how could they do it?

2371
02:16:15,919 --> 02:16:19,006
He was a war hero. He'd already
told everyone about his past.

2372
02:16:19,089 --> 02:16:21,300
Borden dredged it all up.

2373
02:16:21,383 --> 02:16:24,553
How could Borden get access
to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

2374
02:16:24,636 --> 02:16:28,432
- Could it have been Nichols?
- No, I can't imagine he'd do that.

2375
02:16:28,515 --> 02:16:30,517
But whoever did
unleashed a firestorm

2376
02:16:30,601 --> 02:16:34,980
that burned a path from the White
House back to my desk at the AEC.

2377
02:16:35,481 --> 02:16:37,107
You see him in there, right?

2378
02:16:37,858 --> 02:16:40,152
I've worked my
whole life to get here,

2379
02:16:40,944 --> 02:16:43,155
Cabinet of the United
States of America,

2380
02:16:43,238 --> 02:16:46,784
and now, in front of the entire country,
they're gonna put me back in my place.

2381
02:16:48,619 --> 02:16:50,287
A lowly shoe salesman.

2382
02:16:50,996 --> 02:16:53,123
Lewis, we can win this thing.

2383
02:16:53,207 --> 02:16:56,293
I-I think we can get the Senate
to grasp that you did your duty,

2384
02:16:56,377 --> 02:16:58,003
painful though it was.

2385
02:16:58,087 --> 02:17:00,547
- Now, will Hill's testimony back us up?
- Hill will be fine.

2386
02:17:00,631 --> 02:17:01,632
I don't really know him,

2387
02:17:01,715 --> 02:17:04,009
but he was one of
Szilard's boys in Chicago,

2388
02:17:04,093 --> 02:17:05,594
and they never forgave Robert

2389
02:17:05,677 --> 02:17:07,971
for not supporting the
petition against bombing Japan.

2390
02:17:08,055 --> 02:17:09,139
[projector clicks]

2391
02:17:09,223 --> 02:17:12,684
[Morrison] This was taken
31 days after the bombing.

2392
02:17:13,602 --> 02:17:17,898
Virtually everyone in the
street for nearly a mile around,

2393
02:17:18,607 --> 02:17:21,777
was instantly and
seriously burned.

2394
02:17:21,860 --> 02:17:22,945
[audience gasping]

2395
02:17:23,028 --> 02:17:27,783
[Morrison] The Japanese spoke
of people who wore striped clothing

2396
02:17:27,866 --> 02:17:30,494
upon whom, the skin
was burned in stripes.

2397
02:17:31,662 --> 02:17:34,206
There were many who
thought themselves lucky,

2398
02:17:34,289 --> 02:17:38,168
who climbed out of the ruins of
their homes, only slightly injured.

2399
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:41,463
But they died anyway.

2400
02:17:42,423 --> 02:17:46,760
They died days or weeks
later from the radium-like rays

2401
02:17:46,844 --> 02:17:50,722
emitted in great numbers at
the moment of the explosion.

2402
02:17:52,057 --> 02:17:54,143
Did you read this
crap in the papers?

2403
02:17:54,226 --> 02:17:56,228
A British physicist is saying

2404
02:17:56,311 --> 02:17:59,231
the atomic bombings were
not the last act of World War II,

2405
02:17:59,314 --> 02:18:02,192
but the first act of this
cold war with Russia.

2406
02:18:02,276 --> 02:18:03,694
Which physicist?

2407
02:18:03,777 --> 02:18:06,447
I think you knew
him. Patrick Blackett.

2408
02:18:07,948 --> 02:18:09,241
[scoffs]

2409
02:18:09,324 --> 02:18:10,826
He may not be wrong.

2410
02:18:10,909 --> 02:18:12,369
Stimson is now telling me

2411
02:18:12,453 --> 02:18:15,622
we bombed an enemy that
was essentially defeated.

2412
02:18:15,706 --> 02:18:18,208
Robert, you've all
the influence now.

2413
02:18:19,042 --> 02:18:20,586
Please.

2414
02:18:20,669 --> 02:18:22,963
Urge them to continue
my research on the Super.

2415
02:18:23,046 --> 02:18:25,174
I neither can nor will, Edward.

2416
02:18:25,257 --> 02:18:26,592
Why not?

2417
02:18:26,675 --> 02:18:28,194
It's not the right
use of our resources.

2418
02:18:28,218 --> 02:18:30,304
Is that what you really believe?

2419
02:18:31,096 --> 02:18:35,058
J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Sphinx-like guru of the atom.

2420
02:18:36,393 --> 02:18:38,020
Nobody knows what you believe.

2421
02:18:39,229 --> 02:18:41,023
Do you? Hmm?

2422
02:18:41,523 --> 02:18:43,984
[Groves] One final time,
our program director,

2423
02:18:44,067 --> 02:18:45,736
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2424
02:18:47,404 --> 02:18:49,615
[Oppenheimer] I hope
that, in years to come,

2425
02:18:49,698 --> 02:18:52,242
you will look back on
your work here with pride.

2426
02:18:53,035 --> 02:18:57,331
But today that pride must be
tempered with a profound concern.

2427
02:18:59,166 --> 02:19:02,794
If atomic weapons are to be added
to the arsenals of a warring world,

2428
02:19:04,254 --> 02:19:08,509
then the day will come when people
will curse the name of Los Alamos.

2429
02:19:12,763 --> 02:19:15,349
Sorry, Admiral.
Stopped off to get this.

2430
02:19:16,517 --> 02:19:18,477
It seems pretty favorable.

2431
02:19:19,269 --> 02:19:21,730
There's Oppenheimer.
What's the caption?

2432
02:19:21,813 --> 02:19:24,608
Uh, "J. Robert Oppenheimer,
Strauss fought...

2433
02:19:26,443 --> 02:19:27,694
and the US won."

2434
02:19:28,862 --> 02:19:29,863
That'll work.

2435
02:19:29,947 --> 02:19:32,366
Those were your
words from the other day.

2436
02:19:32,449 --> 02:19:33,700
We needed to pivot.

2437
02:19:34,326 --> 02:19:36,912
But how would you know what
Time magazine's gonna write?

2438
02:19:36,995 --> 02:19:38,580
Henry Luce is a friend.

2439
02:19:46,547 --> 02:19:48,757
You sat here and let
me tell you how it's done,

2440
02:19:49,508 --> 02:19:51,635
but you've been
far ahead all along.

2441
02:19:51,718 --> 02:19:54,054
Survival in Washington

2442
02:19:54,930 --> 02:19:57,140
is about knowing
how to get things done.

2443
02:19:57,641 --> 02:19:58,642
Right.

2444
02:20:00,769 --> 02:20:02,604
What was it you
said about Borden?

2445
02:20:02,688 --> 02:20:04,773
"Why get caught holding
the knife yourself?"

2446
02:20:06,900 --> 02:20:09,945
I'm beginning to think Borden
was holding the knife for you.

2447
02:20:12,447 --> 02:20:16,660
It's gonna come down to how much influence
Borden's been able to exert on Teller.

2448
02:20:16,743 --> 02:20:17,786
[Kitty laughing]

2449
02:20:17,869 --> 02:20:19,264
[attorney] Did I say
something funny?

2450
02:20:19,288 --> 02:20:23,875
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden"
when we all know that it's Strauss.

2451
02:20:23,959 --> 02:20:26,420
Lewis brought me
to Princeton, Kitty.

2452
02:20:26,503 --> 02:20:29,214
And then you humiliated
him in front of Congress.

2453
02:20:29,298 --> 02:20:31,800
- But more useful than a sandwich.
- [gallery laughing]

2454
02:20:35,053 --> 02:20:36,054
How'd I do?

2455
02:20:37,306 --> 02:20:39,099
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

2456
02:20:39,182 --> 02:20:40,726
That was six years ago.

2457
02:20:40,809 --> 02:20:44,354
You know the truly
vindictive, patient as saints.

2458
02:20:44,438 --> 02:20:47,107
Strauss has been perfectly
clear that he is neutral.

2459
02:20:47,190 --> 02:20:50,652
- [glass shatters]
- Wake up! It is Strauss!

2460
02:20:50,736 --> 02:20:53,697
It's always been
Strauss, and you know it.

2461
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:55,407
Why won't you fight him?

2462
02:20:56,116 --> 02:20:57,284
Christ's sake.

2463
02:20:58,660 --> 02:21:02,456
It wasn't Nichols, or Hoover,
or one of Truman's guys.

2464
02:21:02,539 --> 02:21:04,916
It was you. You gave
the file to Borden.

2465
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,294
You set him on Oppenheimer.
You convinced him to--

2466
02:21:07,377 --> 02:21:11,798
Borden didn't take
any convincing.

2467
02:21:11,882 --> 02:21:13,717
Take your time,
use the entire file.

2468
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:16,136
Write up your conclusions,
send them to the FBI.

2469
02:21:16,219 --> 02:21:20,557
The material is obviously extensive,
but there's nothing new here.

2470
02:21:20,641 --> 02:21:22,726
[Strauss] Your
conclusions will be.

2471
02:21:22,809 --> 02:21:24,853
And they'll have to be answered.

2472
02:21:24,936 --> 02:21:26,688
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?

2473
02:21:26,772 --> 02:21:30,150
Oppenheimer's too slippery
for that self-promoting clown.

2474
02:21:30,233 --> 02:21:33,028
I've talked it over with Hoover,
he'll hold McCarthy at bay

2475
02:21:33,111 --> 02:21:34,780
while you do this with the AEC.

2476
02:21:34,863 --> 02:21:35,989
A trial.

2477
02:21:36,073 --> 02:21:37,366
No. No trial.

2478
02:21:37,449 --> 02:21:40,202
You can't give
Oppenheimer a platform.

2479
02:21:40,285 --> 02:21:42,120
You can't martyr him.

2480
02:21:42,204 --> 02:21:45,457
We need a systematic destruction
of Oppenheimer's credibility

2481
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:48,877
so he can never again speak
on matters of national security.

2482
02:21:49,670 --> 02:21:50,671
Then what?

2483
02:21:52,339 --> 02:21:55,634
A shabby little room,
far from the limelight.

2484
02:21:55,717 --> 02:21:57,260
[chattering]

2485
02:22:01,431 --> 02:22:03,475
[Strauss] A simple,
bureaucratic procedure.

2486
02:22:03,558 --> 02:22:05,894
His Q clearance
is up for renewal.

2487
02:22:05,977 --> 02:22:08,605
You send your
accusations to the FBI...

2488
02:22:10,899 --> 02:22:13,985
Hoover sends them to the
AEC, you're forced to act.

2489
02:22:15,028 --> 02:22:16,279
You write up an indictment.

2490
02:22:16,363 --> 02:22:20,325
You tell Oppenheimer his security
clearance is not being renewed.

2491
02:22:20,409 --> 02:22:22,369
But offer him the
chance to appeal.

2492
02:22:22,452 --> 02:22:24,746
As you can see,
Robert, it's not yet signed.

2493
02:22:24,830 --> 02:22:27,165
- May I keep this?
- No.

2494
02:22:27,249 --> 02:22:30,961
If you do decide to appeal,
they'll have to send you a copy.

2495
02:22:31,044 --> 02:22:34,673
When he appeals,
and trust me, he will,

2496
02:22:34,756 --> 02:22:36,758
- I appoint a board.
- [chattering]

2497
02:22:36,842 --> 02:22:39,553
They will, of course,
have counsel.

2498
02:22:39,636 --> 02:22:41,304
- [Nichols] Prosecutor?
- In all but name.

2499
02:22:41,388 --> 02:22:43,306
- Who?
- Roger Robb.

2500
02:22:43,390 --> 02:22:44,391
Ouch.

2501
02:22:44,474 --> 02:22:47,686
Robb will have security clearance
to examine Oppenheimer's file.

2502
02:22:47,769 --> 02:22:49,104
As will the Gray board.

2503
02:22:49,187 --> 02:22:50,439
Defense counsel will not.

2504
02:22:51,732 --> 02:22:53,024
A closed hearing.

2505
02:22:53,108 --> 02:22:57,279
"The so-called and derogatory
information in your indictment of me..."

2506
02:22:57,362 --> 02:23:00,907
No audience. No reporters.
No burden of proof.

2507
02:23:01,491 --> 02:23:02,993
No burden of proof?

2508
02:23:04,619 --> 02:23:05,787
We're not convicting.

2509
02:23:06,872 --> 02:23:08,498
We're just denying.

2510
02:23:14,296 --> 02:23:16,256
What is it you said?

2511
02:23:17,132 --> 02:23:20,469
"This is just how
the game is played."

2512
02:23:21,178 --> 02:23:22,929
Well, forgive my naivete.

2513
02:23:23,597 --> 02:23:27,267
Amateurs seek
the sun... get eaten.

2514
02:23:28,602 --> 02:23:31,646
Power stays in the shadows.

2515
02:23:31,730 --> 02:23:34,691
But, sir, you're out
of the shadows now.

2516
02:23:34,775 --> 02:23:36,735
Yeah, that's why
this has to work.

2517
02:23:36,818 --> 02:23:37,986
Well...

2518
02:23:39,696 --> 02:23:42,365
Teller's testifying this
morning. That'll help.

2519
02:23:42,449 --> 02:23:43,950
And then...

2520
02:23:44,034 --> 02:23:45,410
Hill is in the afternoon.

2521
02:23:45,494 --> 02:23:47,120
Hill is gonna help us too.

2522
02:23:50,207 --> 02:23:52,834
[Strauss] As you can see,
Robert, it's not yet signed.

2523
02:23:53,502 --> 02:23:55,170
- May I keep this?
- [Nichols] No.

2524
02:23:57,672 --> 02:24:02,636
If you do decide to appeal, then
they'll have to send you a copy.

2525
02:24:06,056 --> 02:24:08,141
Take my car
and driver. I insist.

2526
02:24:13,021 --> 02:24:14,981
I'll have to consult
my lawyers, Lewis.

2527
02:24:15,065 --> 02:24:17,776
Of course. But
don't take too long.

2528
02:24:17,859 --> 02:24:19,903
I can't keep Nichols at bay.

2529
02:24:26,159 --> 02:24:28,370
I'm sorry it's come
to this, Robert.

2530
02:24:28,453 --> 02:24:29,913
I think it's wrong.

2531
02:24:42,968 --> 02:24:46,429
[Oppenheimer] Nichols wants me to
fight so he can get it all on the record.

2532
02:24:46,513 --> 02:24:48,265
Strauss wants me to walk away.

2533
02:24:48,348 --> 02:24:53,019
Strauss knows that you can't do
that. You'd be accepting the charges.

2534
02:24:53,687 --> 02:24:55,230
You'll lose your job.

2535
02:24:55,313 --> 02:24:58,233
You will lose your reputation.
We'll lose our house.

2536
02:24:58,316 --> 02:24:59,985
Robert, we have to fight.

2537
02:25:03,071 --> 02:25:05,156
As AEC counsel, I
can't represent you.

2538
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:06,783
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

2539
02:25:07,367 --> 02:25:09,578
- He's good.
- The best, but...

2540
02:25:10,579 --> 02:25:11,705
I have to warn you...

2541
02:25:13,373 --> 02:25:15,417
this won't be a fair fight.

2542
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:18,044
During your interview
with Boris Pash in 1943,

2543
02:25:18,128 --> 02:25:19,754
did you refer to microfilm?

2544
02:25:19,838 --> 02:25:23,008
- No.
- Tab 11, page one, paragraph three.

2545
02:25:23,091 --> 02:25:24,527
You never said,
"Man of the consulate

2546
02:25:24,551 --> 02:25:26,511
expert in the use of microfilm."

2547
02:25:26,595 --> 02:25:27,697
- [Garrison] I'm sorry.
- No.

2548
02:25:27,721 --> 02:25:29,949
I would like to know what
document Mr. Robb is quoting from

2549
02:25:29,973 --> 02:25:31,933
and if we might be
furnished with a copy.

2550
02:25:32,017 --> 02:25:33,810
The document is
classified, Mr. Garrison.

2551
02:25:33,894 --> 02:25:36,062
I think we should get back
to firsthand information.

2552
02:25:36,146 --> 02:25:38,815
- This is firsthand.
- How so, Roger?

2553
02:25:40,775 --> 02:25:42,335
There was a recording
of the interview.

2554
02:25:46,948 --> 02:25:49,868
[Garrison] You let my client sit
here and potentially perjure himself

2555
02:25:49,951 --> 02:25:52,412
and all this time,
you had a recording?

2556
02:25:52,495 --> 02:25:55,123
Nobody told your client to
misrepresent his former answers.

2557
02:25:55,206 --> 02:25:57,334
Misrepres-- It was 12 years ago.

2558
02:25:57,417 --> 02:25:58,668
Can we hear this recording?

2559
02:25:58,752 --> 02:26:00,229
You don't have the
clearance, Mr. Garrison.

2560
02:26:00,253 --> 02:26:03,256
- But you're reading it into the record.
- Please, please.

2561
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:07,177
Is this proceeding interested
in entrapment or in truth?

2562
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:11,097
If it's truth, where's the
disclosure? Where's the witness list?

2563
02:26:11,181 --> 02:26:13,892
Mr. Garrison, this isn't a
trial, as you're well aware.

2564
02:26:13,975 --> 02:26:18,146
Evidentiary rules do not apply.
We are dealing with national security.

2565
02:26:18,229 --> 02:26:19,469
Yes, sir, with all due respect,

2566
02:26:19,522 --> 02:26:22,901
I fail to see how national
security prevents the prosecution

2567
02:26:22,984 --> 02:26:25,963
- from providing us a list of witnesses.
- Perhaps we are in need of a brief recess.

2568
02:26:25,987 --> 02:26:28,031
[Oppenheimer] Gentlemen,
you have my words.

2569
02:26:28,114 --> 02:26:30,951
If you say they're from a
transcript, then I'll accept it.

2570
02:26:31,034 --> 02:26:33,745
I've already explained I
made up a cock-and-bull story.

2571
02:26:33,828 --> 02:26:36,915
But why would anyone make
up such an elaborate story?

2572
02:26:36,998 --> 02:26:38,458
Because I was an idiot.

2573
02:26:39,167 --> 02:26:40,794
Why lie?

2574
02:26:40,877 --> 02:26:44,798
Well, clearly with the intention of not
revealing who the intermediary was.

2575
02:26:44,881 --> 02:26:47,425
Your friend, Haakon
Chevalier, the communist?

2576
02:26:47,509 --> 02:26:48,760
Is he still your friend?

2577
02:26:49,761 --> 02:26:50,804
Yes.

2578
02:26:54,057 --> 02:26:56,184
[Garrison] Dr. Rabi,
thank you for coming.

2579
02:26:56,267 --> 02:26:58,120
Do you know who else
the prosecution has called?

2580
02:26:58,144 --> 02:27:00,355
Teller, obviously.

2581
02:27:01,356 --> 02:27:03,692
- They've asked Lawrence.
- What did he say?

2582
02:27:03,775 --> 02:27:07,070
- He wasn't going to help them, but...
- But?

2583
02:27:07,654 --> 02:27:12,117
Strauss told him that you and Ruth Tolman
have been having an affair for years.

2584
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:14,577
The whole time you lived
with them in Pasadena.

2585
02:27:14,661 --> 02:27:18,039
He convinced Lawrence that
Richard died of a broken heart.

2586
02:27:18,123 --> 02:27:19,958
- That's absurd.
- What part?

2587
02:27:20,041 --> 02:27:21,835
The broken heart.

2588
02:27:21,918 --> 02:27:22,961
Richard never found out.

2589
02:27:24,337 --> 02:27:25,672
Is Lawrence gonna testify?

2590
02:27:25,755 --> 02:27:26,881
I don't know.

2591
02:27:27,799 --> 02:27:32,512
[Garrison] Dr. Rabi, what governmental
positions do you currently hold?

2592
02:27:32,595 --> 02:27:36,474
I am the chairman of the General
Advisory Committee to the AEC,

2593
02:27:36,558 --> 02:27:38,351
succeeding Dr. Oppenheimer.

2594
02:27:38,435 --> 02:27:40,562
And how long have you
known Dr. Oppenheimer?

2595
02:27:41,271 --> 02:27:43,523
Since 1928. I...

2596
02:27:43,606 --> 02:27:45,108
I know him quite well.

2597
02:27:45,191 --> 02:27:49,738
Well enough to speak to the
bearing of his loyalty and character?

2598
02:27:49,821 --> 02:27:53,241
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man
of upstanding character.

2599
02:27:53,867 --> 02:27:57,620
And he is loyal to the
United States, to his friends,

2600
02:27:57,704 --> 02:27:59,956
to the institutions
of which he is part.

2601
02:28:01,791 --> 02:28:03,043
Eat.

2602
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:07,922
- [door opens]
- [footsteps approaching]

2603
02:28:22,062 --> 02:28:24,314
- [Oppenheimer] What was that?
- Nothing to worry about.

2604
02:28:27,567 --> 02:28:29,486
[Robb] After the
Russian A-bomb test,

2605
02:28:29,569 --> 02:28:32,197
did Dr. Lawrence come to see
you about the hydrogen bomb?

2606
02:28:32,280 --> 02:28:33,865
You'd be better off asking him.

2607
02:28:33,948 --> 02:28:35,492
Well, I fully intend to.

2608
02:28:36,326 --> 02:28:40,246
Would you say that Dr. Oppenheimer
was unalterably opposed to the H-bomb?

2609
02:28:40,330 --> 02:28:43,333
No, he thought that
a fusion program

2610
02:28:43,416 --> 02:28:46,169
would come at the expense of
our awfully good fission program.

2611
02:28:46,252 --> 02:28:50,173
- But that proved not to be the case.
- In the event, both could be done.

2612
02:28:50,256 --> 02:28:52,926
Suppose that this board
did not feel satisfied that,

2613
02:28:53,009 --> 02:28:57,013
in his testimony here,
Dr. Oppenheimer had been wholly truthful.

2614
02:28:57,097 --> 02:28:59,241
What would you say whether
or not he should be cleared?

2615
02:28:59,265 --> 02:29:01,559
Why go through all
this against a man

2616
02:29:01,643 --> 02:29:03,686
who has accomplished
what Dr. Oppenheimer has?

2617
02:29:03,770 --> 02:29:05,313
Look at his record.

2618
02:29:05,396 --> 02:29:07,649
We have an A-bomb
and a whole series of it.

2619
02:29:07,732 --> 02:29:09,567
We have a whole
series of Super bombs.

2620
02:29:09,651 --> 02:29:12,195
What more do you want? Mermaids?

2621
02:29:12,737 --> 02:29:16,324
[Teller] But I've known
Secretary Strauss for many years,

2622
02:29:16,407 --> 02:29:19,869
and I feel it a necessity to
express the warm support

2623
02:29:19,953 --> 02:29:22,372
for science and scientists
Lewis has shown.

2624
02:29:22,455 --> 02:29:25,333
We'll break now, unless
there's any immediate business.

2625
02:29:25,416 --> 02:29:28,211
[Strauss] Senator, I'd
like to once again request

2626
02:29:28,294 --> 02:29:31,005
that we're furnished
with a list of witnesses.

2627
02:29:31,089 --> 02:29:32,799
And I will remind the nominee

2628
02:29:32,882 --> 02:29:35,510
that we don't always have
that information in advance.

2629
02:29:35,593 --> 02:29:38,680
We do know that Dr. Hill
will be here after lunch.

2630
02:29:38,763 --> 02:29:41,516
Mr. Chairman, our next
scheduled witness, Dr. Lawrence,

2631
02:29:41,599 --> 02:29:44,394
has apparently come
down with colitis.

2632
02:29:47,730 --> 02:29:50,108
So we'll proceed with
William Borden instead.

2633
02:29:51,067 --> 02:29:53,820
Mr. Borden, welcome.
Please take a seat.

2634
02:29:55,155 --> 02:29:59,868
Mr. Borden, during your
investigation into Dr. Oppenheimer,

2635
02:29:59,951 --> 02:30:02,912
- did you reach certain conclusions?
- I did.

2636
02:30:02,996 --> 02:30:05,582
And did there come a time when
you expressed those conclusions

2637
02:30:05,665 --> 02:30:09,085
in a letter to Mr. J. Edgar Hoover of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation?

2638
02:30:09,169 --> 02:30:11,462
- That is correct.
- Prior to the writing of the letter,

2639
02:30:11,546 --> 02:30:13,899
did you discuss the writing of
the letter with anybody attached

2640
02:30:13,923 --> 02:30:15,592
to the Atomic Energy Commission?

2641
02:30:15,675 --> 02:30:17,844
- I did not.
- [Robb] Do you have a copy of the letter?

2642
02:30:17,927 --> 02:30:18,970
I have one in front of me.

2643
02:30:19,053 --> 02:30:21,347
Would you please be
so kind as to read it, sir?

2644
02:30:22,015 --> 02:30:24,851
"Dear Mr. Hoover, the
purpose of this letter is to state"--

2645
02:30:24,934 --> 02:30:27,729
[Garrison] I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, if I could have a--

2646
02:30:27,812 --> 02:30:31,065
What is the purpose of the delay?
He's simply gonna read the letter.

2647
02:30:31,149 --> 02:30:34,402
[chuckles] Mr. Chairman, this
is the first I've seen of this letter,

2648
02:30:34,485 --> 02:30:37,447
and I see statements
here, at least one,

2649
02:30:37,530 --> 02:30:40,092
of a kind that I don't think anyone
would like to see go into the record.

2650
02:30:40,116 --> 02:30:42,744
These are accusations that
have not previously been made.

2651
02:30:42,827 --> 02:30:44,722
That are not part of the
indictment from Nichols.

2652
02:30:44,746 --> 02:30:47,081
Accusations of a kind that
I don't think belong here.

2653
02:30:47,165 --> 02:30:49,250
The witness wrote this
letter on his own initiative,

2654
02:30:49,334 --> 02:30:51,654
laying out evidence that has
already been before the board.

2655
02:30:51,711 --> 02:30:53,379
His conclusions
are valid testimony,

2656
02:30:53,463 --> 02:30:56,716
just like the positive conclusions
of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer.

2657
02:30:56,799 --> 02:30:58,343
It cuts both ways.

2658
02:30:58,426 --> 02:31:00,586
How long has counsel been
in possession of this letter?

2659
02:31:00,637 --> 02:31:04,557
I don't think I should be subject to
cross-examination by you, Mr. Garrison.

2660
02:31:04,641 --> 02:31:07,727
[Gray] Mr. Garrison, given that we
on the board have all read the letter,

2661
02:31:07,810 --> 02:31:10,146
wouldn't it be better
to have it in the record?

2662
02:31:10,230 --> 02:31:11,773
Let's proceed.

2663
02:31:13,691 --> 02:31:15,318
[Borden] "Dear Mr. Hoover,

2664
02:31:15,401 --> 02:31:18,446
the purpose of this letter
is to state my opinion

2665
02:31:18,529 --> 02:31:22,700
based upon years of study of
the available classified evidence,

2666
02:31:22,784 --> 02:31:24,786
that more probably than not

2667
02:31:24,869 --> 02:31:29,707
J. Robert Oppenheimer is
an agent of the Soviet Union.

2668
02:31:29,791 --> 02:31:32,210
The following
conclusions are justified.

2669
02:31:32,293 --> 02:31:36,631
One, between 1929 and
1942, more probably than not,

2670
02:31:36,714 --> 02:31:40,551
J. Robert Oppenheimer was a
sufficiently hardened communist,

2671
02:31:40,635 --> 02:31:43,012
that he volunteered
information to the Soviets.

2672
02:31:43,096 --> 02:31:45,431
Two, more probably than not,

2673
02:31:45,515 --> 02:31:49,143
he has since been functioning
as an espionage agent.

2674
02:31:49,811 --> 02:31:52,313
Three, more probably than not,

2675
02:31:52,397 --> 02:31:54,983
he has since acted
under a Soviet directive

2676
02:31:55,066 --> 02:31:57,860
in influencing United
States military policy"...

2677
02:31:57,944 --> 02:32:00,225
- I'm sorry, Robert.
- ..."atomic energy, intelligence"...

2678
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:05,159
Is anyone ever going to tell the
truth about what's happening here?

2679
02:32:05,243 --> 02:32:08,079
[chairman] We will now
hear from Dr. David Hill.

2680
02:32:08,162 --> 02:32:09,580
[shutters clicking]

2681
02:32:14,836 --> 02:32:15,837
[shutter clicks]

2682
02:32:18,381 --> 02:32:21,384
Dr. Hill, would you care
to make a statement?

2683
02:32:23,386 --> 02:32:24,387
Thank you.

2684
02:32:24,470 --> 02:32:28,474
I've been asked to testify
about Lewis Strauss.

2685
02:32:28,558 --> 02:32:33,813
A man who has given years of
service in high positions of government

2686
02:32:33,896 --> 02:32:38,651
and who is known to be earnest,
hardworking and intelligent.

2687
02:32:39,819 --> 02:32:42,322
The views I have to
express are my own,

2688
02:32:42,405 --> 02:32:45,158
but I believe that much I
have to say will help to indicate

2689
02:32:45,241 --> 02:32:48,703
why most of the
scientists in this country

2690
02:32:48,786 --> 02:32:53,583
would prefer to see Mr. Strauss
completely out of government.

2691
02:32:53,666 --> 02:32:55,668
[gallery murmuring]

2692
02:32:55,752 --> 02:32:59,672
You're referring to the
hostility of certain scientists

2693
02:32:59,756 --> 02:33:03,468
directed toward Mr. Strauss
because of his commitment to security,

2694
02:33:03,551 --> 02:33:06,262
as demonstrated in
the Oppenheimer affair?

2695
02:33:08,723 --> 02:33:09,724
No.

2696
02:33:10,516 --> 02:33:15,063
Because of the personal vindictiveness
he demonstrated against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2697
02:33:15,146 --> 02:33:16,731
[murmuring intensifies]

2698
02:33:16,814 --> 02:33:18,691
- [chairman] Order.
- [gavel rapping]

2699
02:33:18,775 --> 02:33:20,026
Order.

2700
02:33:20,610 --> 02:33:24,113
It appears to most
scientists around this country

2701
02:33:25,406 --> 02:33:28,242
that Robert Oppenheimer
is now being pilloried

2702
02:33:28,326 --> 02:33:32,747
and put through an ordeal because
he expressed his honest opinions.

2703
02:33:32,830 --> 02:33:36,042
Dr. Bush, I thought I was
performing a service to my country

2704
02:33:36,125 --> 02:33:37,251
when hearing this case.

2705
02:33:37,335 --> 02:33:41,839
No board in this country
should sit in judgment of a man

2706
02:33:41,923 --> 02:33:44,008
because he expressed
strong opinions.

2707
02:33:44,092 --> 02:33:46,761
If you wanna try that
case, you should try me.

2708
02:33:47,261 --> 02:33:50,473
Excuse me, gentlemen,
if I become stirred.

2709
02:33:51,349 --> 02:33:52,350
But I am.

2710
02:33:52,934 --> 02:33:56,813
Dr. Hill, we've already heard that
Mr. Strauss did not bring the charges,

2711
02:33:56,896 --> 02:33:59,857
or participate in the hearings
against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2712
02:33:59,941 --> 02:34:04,612
The Oppenheimer matter
was initiated and carried through

2713
02:34:04,695 --> 02:34:07,156
largely through the
animus of Lewis Strauss.

2714
02:34:07,240 --> 02:34:08,616
[gallery murmuring]

2715
02:34:08,699 --> 02:34:11,577
Oppenheimer made mincemeat
out of Strauss's position

2716
02:34:11,661 --> 02:34:13,704
on the shipment of
isotopes to Norway,

2717
02:34:13,788 --> 02:34:17,291
and Strauss never forgave
him this public humiliation.

2718
02:34:17,959 --> 02:34:21,212
Another controversy between them centered
around their differences in judgment

2719
02:34:21,295 --> 02:34:24,382
on how the H-bomb would
contribute to national security.

2720
02:34:24,465 --> 02:34:26,926
Strauss turned to the
personnel security system

2721
02:34:27,009 --> 02:34:30,596
in order to destroy
Oppenheimer's effectiveness.

2722
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:33,558
And Strauss was able to
find a few ambitious men

2723
02:34:33,641 --> 02:34:36,394
who also disagreed with
Oppenheimer's positions

2724
02:34:36,477 --> 02:34:39,856
and envied him his prestige
in government circles.

2725
02:34:39,939 --> 02:34:44,026
I've always assumed, and still assume,
that he's loyal to the United States.

2726
02:34:44,652 --> 02:34:45,653
I believe this.

2727
02:34:45,736 --> 02:34:49,157
And I shall believe it until I see
very conclusive proof to the opposite.

2728
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:52,952
Do you, or do you not, believe that
Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

2729
02:34:56,831 --> 02:34:58,124
In a great number of cases,

2730
02:34:58,207 --> 02:35:01,544
I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer
act in a way which was, to me,

2731
02:35:01,627 --> 02:35:03,546
exceedingly hard to understand.

2732
02:35:03,629 --> 02:35:06,215
I thoroughly disagreed
with him in numerous issues,

2733
02:35:06,299 --> 02:35:09,719
and his actions, frankly, appeared
to me confused and complicated.

2734
02:35:09,802 --> 02:35:11,512
To this extent, I feel,

2735
02:35:11,596 --> 02:35:14,557
I want to see the vital
interests of this country

2736
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:16,726
in hands which I
understand better,

2737
02:35:16,809 --> 02:35:18,644
and therefore trust more.

2738
02:35:19,479 --> 02:35:21,230
- Thank you, Doctor.
- [Robb] Thank you.

2739
02:35:24,984 --> 02:35:26,068
I'm sorry.

2740
02:35:28,863 --> 02:35:31,115
[Kitty] You shook
his fucking hand?

2741
02:35:31,991 --> 02:35:33,993
Oh, I would have
spit in his face.

2742
02:35:34,076 --> 02:35:35,995
Not sure the board would
have appreciated that.

2743
02:35:36,078 --> 02:35:37,955
Is it not gentlemanly
enough for you?

2744
02:35:38,039 --> 02:35:40,625
I think you're all being
too goddamn gentlemanly.

2745
02:35:40,708 --> 02:35:42,627
Gray must see
what Robb is doing.

2746
02:35:42,710 --> 02:35:44,545
Why doesn't he
just shut him down?

2747
02:35:44,629 --> 02:35:47,215
And you shaking Teller's hand.

2748
02:35:47,298 --> 02:35:50,343
You need to stop
playing the martyr.

2749
02:35:51,135 --> 02:35:56,098
Under the current AEC guidelines,
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

2750
02:36:02,104 --> 02:36:06,651
Under my interpretation
of the Atomic Energy Act,

2751
02:36:06,734 --> 02:36:11,322
which did not exist when I
hired Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942,

2752
02:36:12,615 --> 02:36:18,120
I would not clear him today
if I were on the commission.

2753
02:36:18,204 --> 02:36:19,806
[Robb] Good, thank
you, General, that is all.

2754
02:36:19,830 --> 02:36:22,333
But I don't think I'd
clear any of those guys.

2755
02:36:22,416 --> 02:36:23,417
That's all.

2756
02:36:26,504 --> 02:36:28,631
[Garrison] Dr. Oppenheimer
had no responsibility

2757
02:36:28,714 --> 02:36:31,217
in the selection or the
clearance of Klaus Fuchs, did he?

2758
02:36:31,300 --> 02:36:32,552
No. None at all.

2759
02:36:32,635 --> 02:36:35,805
And you wouldn't want to leave
this board with any suggestion today

2760
02:36:35,888 --> 02:36:39,016
that you're here questioning his
basic loyalty to the United States

2761
02:36:39,100 --> 02:36:40,601
and the operation of Los Alamos.

2762
02:36:40,685 --> 02:36:42,019
By no means.

2763
02:36:42,103 --> 02:36:45,022
I hope I didn't lead anyone to
believe otherwise for an instant.

2764
02:36:46,315 --> 02:36:47,525
[Gray] Thank you, General.

2765
02:36:56,909 --> 02:36:58,619
[door opens]

2766
02:37:05,042 --> 02:37:07,169
Okay. We shouldn't
keep them waiting.

2767
02:37:07,253 --> 02:37:08,254
She'll be here.

2768
02:37:08,754 --> 02:37:10,047
Do you even want her here?

2769
02:37:10,631 --> 02:37:12,550
Only a fool or an adolescent

2770
02:37:12,633 --> 02:37:14,677
presumes to know
someone else's relationship,

2771
02:37:14,760 --> 02:37:16,679
and you're neither, Lloyd.

2772
02:37:16,762 --> 02:37:18,347
- [door opens]
- [footsteps approaching]

2773
02:37:19,390 --> 02:37:22,143
Kitty and I, we're grown-ups.

2774
02:37:23,227 --> 02:37:25,313
We've walked
through fire together.

2775
02:37:25,896 --> 02:37:27,148
She'll do fine.

2776
02:37:28,065 --> 02:37:32,236
[Garrison] Would you describe your
views on communism as pro, anti, neutral?

2777
02:37:32,320 --> 02:37:33,463
[Kitty] Very strongly against.

2778
02:37:33,487 --> 02:37:38,034
I've had nothing to do with
communism since 1936, since...

2779
02:37:39,160 --> 02:37:40,995
since before I met Robert.

2780
02:37:42,788 --> 02:37:43,914
That's all.

2781
02:37:44,999 --> 02:37:46,810
[Hill] The record
demonstrates that Oppenheimer

2782
02:37:46,834 --> 02:37:50,046
was not interrogated by
impartial and disinterested counsel

2783
02:37:50,129 --> 02:37:51,130
for the Gray board.

2784
02:37:51,213 --> 02:37:53,049
He was interrogated
by a prosecutor

2785
02:37:53,132 --> 02:37:55,843
who used all the tricks of a
rather ingenious legal background.

2786
02:37:55,926 --> 02:38:00,264
You are charging now that the
Gray board permitted a prosecution.

2787
02:38:01,015 --> 02:38:03,100
If I were on the Gray board,

2788
02:38:03,184 --> 02:38:06,520
I would have protested against the
tactics of the man who served, in fact,

2789
02:38:06,604 --> 02:38:08,064
as the prosecuting counsel.

2790
02:38:08,147 --> 02:38:09,982
A man appointed,
not by the board...

2791
02:38:11,275 --> 02:38:12,568
but by Lewis Strauss.

2792
02:38:13,444 --> 02:38:14,695
[gallery murmuring]

2793
02:38:15,321 --> 02:38:16,321
Who was this?

2794
02:38:17,907 --> 02:38:19,575
I'm sorry?

2795
02:38:19,659 --> 02:38:20,826
[McGee] Who was this?

2796
02:38:20,910 --> 02:38:22,161
Uh, Roger Robb.

2797
02:38:22,828 --> 02:38:24,163
Mrs. Oppenheimer.

2798
02:38:28,668 --> 02:38:30,836
Did you have a Communist
Party membership card?

2799
02:38:32,672 --> 02:38:33,839
I'm--

2800
02:38:33,923 --> 02:38:34,924
I'm not sure.

2801
02:38:35,007 --> 02:38:36,217
Not sure?

2802
02:38:38,928 --> 02:38:40,054
Well--

2803
02:38:43,099 --> 02:38:44,100
Well?

2804
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:56,362
I mean, presumably,
the act of joining the Party

2805
02:38:56,445 --> 02:38:59,657
required sending some
money and receiving a card, no?

2806
02:39:02,618 --> 02:39:03,619
Yeah.

2807
02:39:07,373 --> 02:39:08,916
[sighs]

2808
02:39:09,667 --> 02:39:10,835
Sorry.

2809
02:39:11,877 --> 02:39:13,212
[Robb] Yeah.

2810
02:39:15,256 --> 02:39:18,592
It's just it was all so very
long ago, Mr. Robb, wasn't it?

2811
02:39:18,676 --> 02:39:20,362
- Not really.
- Long enough to have forgotten.

2812
02:39:20,386 --> 02:39:23,573
- Did you return the card or rip it up?
- The card whose existence I've forgotten?

2813
02:39:23,597 --> 02:39:26,559
- Your Communist Party membership card.
- Haven't the slightest idea.

2814
02:39:29,395 --> 02:39:33,816
Can a distinction be made between
Soviet communism and communism?

2815
02:39:33,899 --> 02:39:37,027
In the days when I was a member, I
thought they were definitely two things.

2816
02:39:37,111 --> 02:39:40,156
I thought that the Communist
Party of the United States

2817
02:39:40,239 --> 02:39:42,700
was concerned with
our domestic problems.

2818
02:39:42,783 --> 02:39:43,951
I now no longer believe this.

2819
02:39:44,034 --> 02:39:46,596
I believe the thing's linked together
and spread all over the world,

2820
02:39:46,620 --> 02:39:50,332
and I have believed this since
I left the Party, 16 years ago.

2821
02:39:50,416 --> 02:39:52,918
- But--
- 17 years ago. My mistake.

2822
02:39:53,502 --> 02:39:54,920
- But you sai--
- Sorry, 18.

2823
02:39:56,338 --> 02:39:57,631
18 years ago.

2824
02:39:58,883 --> 02:40:01,761
Are you familiar with the fact your
husband was making contributions

2825
02:40:01,844 --> 02:40:04,013
to the Spanish Civil
War as late as 1942?

2826
02:40:04,096 --> 02:40:06,390
I knew that Robert gave
money from time to time.

2827
02:40:06,474 --> 02:40:08,994
Did you know this money was
going into Communist Party channels?

2828
02:40:09,018 --> 02:40:11,061
- Don't you mean "through"?
- Pardon?

2829
02:40:11,145 --> 02:40:13,647
I think you mean "through
Communist Party channels," don't you?

2830
02:40:13,731 --> 02:40:15,316
- Yes!
- Yes?

2831
02:40:15,399 --> 02:40:17,443
- Yes!
- Yes.

2832
02:40:17,526 --> 02:40:20,529
Then would it be fair to say
that this meant that by 1942,

2833
02:40:20,613 --> 02:40:24,492
your husband had not stopped having
anything to do with the Communist Party?

2834
02:40:24,575 --> 02:40:27,637
You don't have to answer that yes or
no. You can answer that any way you wish.

2835
02:40:27,661 --> 02:40:29,371
I know that, thank you.

2836
02:40:29,455 --> 02:40:31,207
It's your question.

2837
02:40:31,290 --> 02:40:32,750
It's not properly phrased.

2838
02:40:32,833 --> 02:40:34,561
- Do you understand what I'm getting at?
- I do.

2839
02:40:34,585 --> 02:40:37,546
- Then why don't you answer it that way?
- 'Cause I don't like your phrase.

2840
02:40:37,630 --> 02:40:39,524
"Having anything to do
with the Communist Party."

2841
02:40:39,548 --> 02:40:42,676
Because Robert never had anything
to do with the Communist Party as such.

2842
02:40:42,760 --> 02:40:45,095
I know he gave money
to Spanish refugees.

2843
02:40:45,179 --> 02:40:48,349
I know he took an intellectual
interest in communist ideas--

2844
02:40:48,432 --> 02:40:50,184
Are there two types
of communists?

2845
02:40:50,267 --> 02:40:52,978
Intellectual communists and
your plain, old, regular commie?

2846
02:40:53,062 --> 02:40:54,188
[laughs]

2847
02:40:54,271 --> 02:40:55,898
Well, I couldn't
answer that one.

2848
02:40:55,981 --> 02:40:58,526
[Evans chuckles]
I couldn't either.

2849
02:41:05,449 --> 02:41:06,700
Good evening.

2850
02:41:06,784 --> 02:41:08,118
Robert, you can't
win this thing.

2851
02:41:08,202 --> 02:41:10,496
It's a kangaroo court with
a predetermined outcome.

2852
02:41:10,579 --> 02:41:14,500
- Why put yourself through more of it?
- I have my reasons.

2853
02:41:16,001 --> 02:41:17,169
All right.

2854
02:41:17,253 --> 02:41:18,462
Good night.

2855
02:41:18,546 --> 02:41:19,797
[car door closes]

2856
02:41:23,175 --> 02:41:24,510
He has a point.

2857
02:41:25,761 --> 02:41:27,596
I'm not sure you
understand, Albert.

2858
02:41:27,680 --> 02:41:28,722
No?

2859
02:41:29,306 --> 02:41:31,934
I left my country
never to return.

2860
02:41:32,893 --> 02:41:34,979
You served your country well.

2861
02:41:35,062 --> 02:41:37,940
If this is the reward
she offers you, then...

2862
02:41:38,899 --> 02:41:41,235
perhaps you should
turn your back on her.

2863
02:41:42,278 --> 02:41:44,321
Damn it, I happen
to love this country.

2864
02:41:45,114 --> 02:41:47,408
Then tell them to go to hell.

2865
02:41:47,491 --> 02:41:48,951
Interestingly enough,

2866
02:41:49,034 --> 02:41:51,453
this is no longer a
confirmation hearing,

2867
02:41:51,537 --> 02:41:54,331
it's now a trial about a trial!

2868
02:41:56,125 --> 02:41:59,044
It's not good he's telling
everyone you initiated the hearings.

2869
02:41:59,128 --> 02:42:01,171
He can't prove a goddamn thing.

2870
02:42:01,255 --> 02:42:04,758
He certainly can't prove
that I gave the file to Borden.

2871
02:42:04,842 --> 02:42:07,887
We're not in court, sir.
There's no burden of proof.

2872
02:42:07,970 --> 02:42:09,680
Right. They're not convicting...

2873
02:42:10,598 --> 02:42:11,599
just denying.

2874
02:42:12,516 --> 02:42:15,436
But why would Hill come here to
tear me down? What's his angle?

2875
02:42:15,519 --> 02:42:18,314
Do people need a reason
to do the right thing?

2876
02:42:18,397 --> 02:42:19,315
As he sees it.

2877
02:42:19,398 --> 02:42:22,693
I told you, Oppenheimer
poisoned the scientists against me,

2878
02:42:22,776 --> 02:42:24,153
right from that first meeting.

2879
02:42:24,236 --> 02:42:27,239
I don't know what Oppenheimer
said to him that day,

2880
02:42:27,323 --> 02:42:30,200
but Einstein wouldn't
even meet my eye.

2881
02:42:30,284 --> 02:42:31,619
[no audible dialogue]

2882
02:42:31,702 --> 02:42:34,538
[Strauss] Oppenheimer knows
how to manipulate his own.

2883
02:42:34,622 --> 02:42:38,375
And at Los Alamos, he preyed
on the naivete of scientists

2884
02:42:38,459 --> 02:42:40,628
who thought they'd get a
say in how we used their work.

2885
02:42:40,711 --> 02:42:42,922
Don't ever think he
was that naive himself.

2886
02:42:43,672 --> 02:42:45,049
[Robb] Doctor.

2887
02:42:45,132 --> 02:42:49,929
During your work on the hydrogen bomb,
were you deterred by any moral qualms?

2888
02:42:50,763 --> 02:42:51,972
Yes, of course.

2889
02:42:52,056 --> 02:42:53,936
But you still got on with
your work, didn't you?

2890
02:42:53,974 --> 02:42:58,145
Yes, because this was work of exploration.
It was not the preparation of a weapon.

2891
02:42:58,228 --> 02:43:00,314
You mean it was more
of an academic excursion?

2892
02:43:00,397 --> 02:43:03,400
No, it is not an academic thing
whether you can build a hydrogen bomb.

2893
02:43:03,484 --> 02:43:04,753
It's a matter of life and death.

2894
02:43:04,777 --> 02:43:05,986
By 1942,

2895
02:43:06,070 --> 02:43:08,381
you were actively pushing the development
of the hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

2896
02:43:08,405 --> 02:43:11,575
Pushing's not the right word.
Supporting it and working on it, yes.

2897
02:43:11,659 --> 02:43:14,036
So when did these moral
qualms become so strong

2898
02:43:14,119 --> 02:43:17,122
that you actively opposed the
development of the hydrogen bomb?

2899
02:43:17,206 --> 02:43:19,959
When it was suggested that it
be the policy of the United States

2900
02:43:20,042 --> 02:43:22,878
to make these things at all
cost, without regard to the balance

2901
02:43:22,962 --> 02:43:26,465
between these weapons and
atomic weapons as part of our arsenal.

2902
02:43:27,925 --> 02:43:30,010
What do moral qualms
have to do with that?

2903
02:43:30,719 --> 02:43:33,555
- What do moral qualms have to do with it?
- Yes.

2904
02:43:33,639 --> 02:43:35,724
Oppenheimer wanted
to own the atomic bomb.

2905
02:43:35,808 --> 02:43:37,768
He wanted to be the
man who moved the Earth.

2906
02:43:37,851 --> 02:43:42,314
He talks about putting the
nuclear genie back in the bottle.

2907
02:43:42,398 --> 02:43:45,901
Well, I'm here to tell you that I
know J. Robert Oppenheimer,

2908
02:43:45,985 --> 02:43:49,196
and if he could do it all
over, he'd do it all the same.

2909
02:43:49,279 --> 02:43:52,992
You know he's never once
said that he regrets Hiroshima?

2910
02:43:53,075 --> 02:43:55,828
He'd do it all over. Why?

2911
02:43:55,911 --> 02:43:59,707
Because it made him the most
important man who ever lived.

2912
02:43:59,790 --> 02:44:03,544
[stammering] Well, we've
freely used the atomic bomb--

2913
02:44:03,627 --> 02:44:05,730
[Robb] In fact, Doctor, you
assisted in selecting the target

2914
02:44:05,754 --> 02:44:07,923
to drop the atomic bomb
on Japan, didn't you?

2915
02:44:08,007 --> 02:44:09,883
- Yes.
- [Robb] Then you knew, did you not,

2916
02:44:09,967 --> 02:44:12,278
that by dropping that atomic
bomb on the target you selected,

2917
02:44:12,302 --> 02:44:15,222
that thousands of civilians would
be killed or injured, is that correct?

2918
02:44:15,305 --> 02:44:17,474
- Yes, not as many as turned out--
- [feet stamping]

2919
02:44:17,558 --> 02:44:20,060
Oh. Well, how many
were killed or injured?

2920
02:44:20,144 --> 02:44:21,228
70,000.

2921
02:44:21,311 --> 02:44:22,688
70,000 at both Hiroshima and--

2922
02:44:22,771 --> 02:44:24,523
110,000 at both.

2923
02:44:24,606 --> 02:44:26,191
[Robb] On the day
of each bombing?

2924
02:44:27,735 --> 02:44:29,987
- Yes.
- And in the weeks and years that followed?

2925
02:44:30,070 --> 02:44:33,323
It has been put at somewhere
between 50,000 and 100,000.

2926
02:44:33,407 --> 02:44:35,492
- 220,000 dead, at least.
- [Oppenheimer] Yes.

2927
02:44:35,576 --> 02:44:37,119
Any moral scruples about that?

2928
02:44:39,038 --> 02:44:40,039
Terrible ones.

2929
02:44:40,122 --> 02:44:43,917
Yet you testified in here that the
bombing of Hiroshima was very successful.

2930
02:44:44,001 --> 02:44:47,046
- Technically successful.
- Oh! Technically, it was very successful.

2931
02:44:47,129 --> 02:44:49,506
And it is also alleged to
have helped end the war.

2932
02:44:49,590 --> 02:44:52,710
Would you have been supportive of the
dropping of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

2933
02:44:52,760 --> 02:44:55,137
- That would make no sense at all.
- Why?

2934
02:44:55,220 --> 02:44:57,056
[stammering] The
target is too small.

2935
02:44:57,139 --> 02:44:59,641
Well, supposing there had
been a target in Japan big enough

2936
02:44:59,725 --> 02:45:01,101
for a thermonuclear weapon,

2937
02:45:01,185 --> 02:45:02,787
would you have been
opposed to the dropping of it?

2938
02:45:02,811 --> 02:45:04,581
This was not a problem
with which I was confronted--

2939
02:45:04,605 --> 02:45:06,085
I'm confronting
you with it now, sir.

2940
02:45:06,148 --> 02:45:07,816
It was all part of his plan.

2941
02:45:07,900 --> 02:45:11,737
He wanted the glorious,
insincere guilt of the self-important

2942
02:45:11,820 --> 02:45:13,781
to wear like a fucking crown.

2943
02:45:13,864 --> 02:45:19,369
Say, "No, we cannot go down this
road," even as he knew we'd have to.

2944
02:45:19,453 --> 02:45:21,133
Would you have been
opposed to the dropping

2945
02:45:21,205 --> 02:45:23,600
of a thermonuclear weapon on
Japan because of moral scruples?

2946
02:45:23,624 --> 02:45:25,060
- Yes, I believe I would, sir.
- [feet stamping]

2947
02:45:25,084 --> 02:45:26,144
Did you oppose the dropping

2948
02:45:26,168 --> 02:45:28,879
of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima
because of moral scruples?

2949
02:45:28,962 --> 02:45:30,881
- We set forth our arg--
- No, you.

2950
02:45:30,964 --> 02:45:32,674
- I'm asking you. You!
- I set--

2951
02:45:32,758 --> 02:45:35,052
I set forth our arguments
against dropping it,

2952
02:45:35,135 --> 02:45:36,905
- but I did not endorse them.
- [stamping intensifies]

2953
02:45:36,929 --> 02:45:40,057
You mean after working night and
day for three years building the bomb,

2954
02:45:40,140 --> 02:45:42,101
you then argued against
the use of it. [laughs]

2955
02:45:42,184 --> 02:45:45,896
I was asked by the secretary of
war what the views of scientists were.

2956
02:45:45,979 --> 02:45:48,190
I gave him the views
against and the views for.

2957
02:45:48,273 --> 02:45:50,692
You supported the dropping
of the atom bomb on Japan.

2958
02:45:50,776 --> 02:45:53,278
- What do you mean, "support"?
- [Robb] You supported it.

2959
02:45:53,362 --> 02:45:55,823
- You helped pick the target, didn't you?
- I did my job.

2960
02:45:55,906 --> 02:45:58,283
I was not in a policy-making
position at Los Alamos.

2961
02:45:58,367 --> 02:46:00,327
I would have done
anything I was asked to do.

2962
02:46:00,410 --> 02:46:02,830
Then you would have built
the H-bomb too, wouldn't you?

2963
02:46:02,913 --> 02:46:04,957
- I couldn't.
- I didn't ask you that, Doctor.

2964
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:06,375
And the GAC report,

2965
02:46:06,458 --> 02:46:09,044
which you co-authored
after the Soviet atomic test,

2966
02:46:09,128 --> 02:46:12,589
- said a Super bomb should never be built.
- [stamping intensifies]

2967
02:46:12,673 --> 02:46:14,049
What we meant--
What I meant was--

2968
02:46:14,133 --> 02:46:15,968
- What you? Who? Who?
- What I meant--

2969
02:46:17,886 --> 02:46:20,764
And wouldn't the Russians do
anything to increase their strength?

2970
02:46:20,848 --> 02:46:23,392
- [stamping stops]
- If we did it, they would have to do it.

2971
02:46:23,475 --> 02:46:27,729
Our efforts would only fuel their efforts,
just as it had with the atomic bomb.

2972
02:46:27,813 --> 02:46:30,816
"Just as it had with the
atomic bomb," exactly!

2973
02:46:31,525 --> 02:46:35,779
No moral scruples in
1945, plenty in 1949.

2974
02:46:40,075 --> 02:46:41,243
[Gray] Dr. Oppenheimer...

2975
02:46:43,453 --> 02:46:46,206
when did your strong
moral convictions develop

2976
02:46:46,290 --> 02:46:48,083
with respect to the
hydrogen bomb?

2977
02:46:55,924 --> 02:46:57,759
When it became clear to me...

2978
02:46:59,219 --> 02:47:02,264
that we would tend to
use any weapon we had.

2979
02:47:05,309 --> 02:47:07,519
[Strauss] J. Robert
Oppenheimer the Martyr.

2980
02:47:07,603 --> 02:47:10,147
I gave him exactly
what he wanted.

2981
02:47:10,731 --> 02:47:14,359
To be remembered for
Trinity, not Hiroshima.

2982
02:47:15,110 --> 02:47:17,237
Not Nagasaki.

2983
02:47:20,199 --> 02:47:21,950
He should be thanking me.

2984
02:47:22,993 --> 02:47:24,286
Well, he's not.

2985
02:47:27,706 --> 02:47:29,124
Do we still have enough votes,

2986
02:47:29,208 --> 02:47:31,126
or is the crowning
moment of my career

2987
02:47:31,210 --> 02:47:34,296
about to become the most
public humiliation of my life?

2988
02:47:35,214 --> 02:47:38,842
Full Senate's about to
vote. You'll scrape through.

2989
02:47:38,926 --> 02:47:40,510
Great, then gather
the fucking press.

2990
02:47:41,094 --> 02:47:42,471
[Gray] Dr. J. Robert
Oppenheimer.

2991
02:47:42,554 --> 02:47:45,557
This board, having
heard testimony from you

2992
02:47:45,641 --> 02:47:48,852
and many of your current
and former colleagues,

2993
02:47:48,936 --> 02:47:53,023
has come to the unanimous
conclusion that you are a loyal citizen.

2994
02:47:55,275 --> 02:48:00,489
However, in the light of
your continuing associations

2995
02:48:00,572 --> 02:48:04,034
and disregard for the security
apparatus of this country,

2996
02:48:04,117 --> 02:48:07,579
together with your
somewhat disturbing conduct

2997
02:48:07,663 --> 02:48:09,581
on the hydrogen bomb program,

2998
02:48:09,665 --> 02:48:11,333
and the regrettable
lack of candor

2999
02:48:11,416 --> 02:48:14,294
in certain of your
responses to this board,

3000
02:48:14,378 --> 02:48:17,214
we have voted two-to-one

3001
02:48:17,297 --> 02:48:20,342
to deny the renewal of
your security clearance.

3002
02:48:20,425 --> 02:48:23,387
A full written opinion, with
a dissent from Mr. Evans,

3003
02:48:23,470 --> 02:48:26,640
will be issued to the
AEC in the coming days.

3004
02:48:26,723 --> 02:48:27,933
That is all.

3005
02:48:32,354 --> 02:48:33,855
Gordon.

3006
02:48:33,939 --> 02:48:35,482
[indistinct]

3007
02:48:38,652 --> 02:48:40,153
[Kitty on phone] Robert.

3008
02:48:40,988 --> 02:48:42,030
Robert.

3009
02:48:45,158 --> 02:48:46,451
Don't, uh...

3010
02:48:49,288 --> 02:48:50,789
Don't take in the sheets.

3011
02:48:52,416 --> 02:48:54,334
[reporters clamoring]

3012
02:48:56,211 --> 02:48:58,314
- [reporter] Sir.
- [Senate aide] Two minutes. Two minutes.

3013
02:48:58,338 --> 02:49:00,173
You'll get your shot.

3014
02:49:00,882 --> 02:49:02,467
[clamoring continues]

3015
02:49:03,885 --> 02:49:05,053
[Strauss] Is it official?

3016
02:49:07,347 --> 02:49:11,059
[Senate aide] Well, there were
a couple of unexpected holdouts.

3017
02:49:16,315 --> 02:49:18,358
I'm denied. Yeah?

3018
02:49:19,151 --> 02:49:20,819
- I'm afraid so, sir.
- All right.

3019
02:49:28,493 --> 02:49:29,661
Who were the holdouts?

3020
02:49:29,745 --> 02:49:32,539
Um... There were three,

3021
02:49:32,622 --> 02:49:35,042
led by the junior senator
from Massachusetts.

3022
02:49:35,125 --> 02:49:37,252
Young guy trying to
make a name for himself,

3023
02:49:37,336 --> 02:49:39,588
didn't like what you
did to Oppenheimer.

3024
02:49:39,671 --> 02:49:40,672
What's his name?

3025
02:49:41,590 --> 02:49:44,676
Uh, Kennedy. John F. Kennedy.

3026
02:49:48,513 --> 02:49:49,681
Kitty?

3027
02:49:55,937 --> 02:49:59,316
Did you think that if you
let them tar and feather you,

3028
02:49:59,399 --> 02:50:01,526
that the world
would forgive you?

3029
02:50:05,405 --> 02:50:06,907
It won't.

3030
02:50:09,242 --> 02:50:10,452
We'll see.

3031
02:50:20,504 --> 02:50:21,963
Goddamn it.

3032
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:24,883
[muttering]

3033
02:50:24,966 --> 02:50:26,885
You told me I'd be okay.

3034
02:50:26,968 --> 02:50:29,262
Yeah, well, I didn't
have all the facts, did I?

3035
02:50:29,346 --> 02:50:30,389
Here's a fact.

3036
02:50:30,472 --> 02:50:32,641
President Eisenhower
pinned the Medal of Freedom

3037
02:50:32,724 --> 02:50:34,142
on my chest last year,

3038
02:50:34,226 --> 02:50:36,686
'cause I've always done
what's right for this country.

3039
02:50:36,770 --> 02:50:39,064
They don't want me
in the Cabinet room?

3040
02:50:39,147 --> 02:50:41,608
Oh, that's-- That's fine.

3041
02:50:41,691 --> 02:50:43,985
Maybe they should just
invite Oppenheimer instead.

3042
02:50:44,069 --> 02:50:45,987
Maybe they will.

3043
02:50:46,071 --> 02:50:49,991
I told you, he turned the
scientists against me one by one,

3044
02:50:50,075 --> 02:50:51,243
starting with Einstein.

3045
02:50:51,326 --> 02:50:53,703
I told you about Einstein.
I saw him by the pond.

3046
02:50:53,787 --> 02:50:55,122
You did, but you know, sir,

3047
02:50:55,205 --> 02:50:59,084
since nobody really knows what
they said to each other that day,

3048
02:50:59,167 --> 02:51:02,712
is it possible they didn't
talk about you at all?

3049
02:51:02,796 --> 02:51:05,048
Is it possible they
spoke about something...

3050
02:51:06,216 --> 02:51:07,634
more important?

3051
02:51:07,717 --> 02:51:09,594
- [reporter] Mr. Strauss!
- [all clamoring]

3052
02:51:09,678 --> 02:51:11,221
[camera shutters clicking]

3053
02:51:18,478 --> 02:51:20,188
Oh! [chuckles]

3054
02:51:22,566 --> 02:51:23,733
Thank you. [chuckles]

3055
02:51:23,817 --> 02:51:25,193
Albert.

3056
02:51:26,445 --> 02:51:28,405
- Ah...
- [clears throat]

3057
02:51:28,488 --> 02:51:30,031
The man of the moment.

3058
02:51:34,119 --> 02:51:37,372
You once held a
reception for me.

3059
02:51:37,456 --> 02:51:40,876
- In Berkeley. You gave me an award, mmm?
- Yes.

3060
02:51:41,751 --> 02:51:45,172
You all thought that I had
lost the ability to understand

3061
02:51:45,255 --> 02:51:47,090
what I'd started.

3062
02:51:47,174 --> 02:51:50,719
So, the award
really wasn't for me.

3063
02:51:50,802 --> 02:51:53,138
It was for all of you, hmm?

3064
02:51:54,890 --> 02:51:56,266
Now it's your turn

3065
02:51:57,100 --> 02:52:01,521
to deal with the consequences
of your achievement.

3066
02:52:02,689 --> 02:52:04,232
And one day,

3067
02:52:04,316 --> 02:52:06,318
when they've
punished you enough...

3068
02:52:08,278 --> 02:52:11,823
they'll serve you
salmon and potato salad.

3069
02:52:16,286 --> 02:52:17,454
Make speeches...

3070
02:52:17,537 --> 02:52:19,206
[no audible dialogue]

3071
02:52:19,289 --> 02:52:20,749
...give you a medal.

3072
02:52:22,751 --> 02:52:24,169
Hello, Frank.

3073
02:52:24,252 --> 02:52:25,587
You're happy, I'm happy.

3074
02:52:32,844 --> 02:52:35,514
[Einstein] Pat you on the
back, tell you all is forgiven.

3075
02:52:37,390 --> 02:52:38,391
Just remember...

3076
02:52:40,310 --> 02:52:42,103
it won't be for you.

3077
02:52:47,317 --> 02:52:48,652
It'll be for them.

3078
02:53:02,165 --> 02:53:03,458
Albert.

3079
02:53:05,210 --> 02:53:08,588
When I came to you
with those calculations,

3080
02:53:08,672 --> 02:53:12,384
we thought we might start
a chain reaction that would

3081
02:53:12,467 --> 02:53:14,302
destroy the entire world?

3082
02:53:15,220 --> 02:53:18,765
Mmm. I remember
it well. What of it?

3083
02:53:22,727 --> 02:53:24,271
I believe we did.

3084
02:53:27,440 --> 02:53:28,817
[feet stamping]
